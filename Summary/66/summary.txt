1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 43 to 78, indicating that both younger and older candidates can be successful, suggesting experience and relevance in the field are valued.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with high proficiency in English being common across all candidates, and varying levels in other languages (French, Russian, Spanish). This suggests that proficiency in English is a significant advantage, while additional language skills can be beneficial but are not mandatory.

2. **Gender**:
   - The information provided does not mention gender, so it is not possible to determine if there is a gender advantage based on the given data.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Azerbaijan, India, Switzerland, United States/Cuba). This indicates that there is no specific nationality that has an inherent advantage; rather, the candidates' qualifications and experiences are more critical factors.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates have studied and worked in various legal traditions, including civil law (Azerbaijan, Switzerland) and common law (India, United States). This diversity suggests that familiarity with different legal systems can be an asset, indicating a preference for candidates who have experience or education in multiple legal traditions.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries (United States, Switzerland) and non-OECD countries (Azerbaijan, India, Iran). This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the location of education is not a decisive factor; rather, the quality and relevance of the education and how it aligns with the candidate's subsequent experiences and contributions to human rights are more critical.

In summary, successful candidates for the role of Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order in the UN Human Rights Council exhibit a range of ages, language proficiencies, and educational and professional backgrounds. There is no single factor that guarantees success, but a combination of relevant experience, diverse legal knowledge, and the ability to communicate effectively in English appear to be significant advantages.
