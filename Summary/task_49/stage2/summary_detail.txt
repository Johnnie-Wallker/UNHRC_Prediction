1. **Age Trend**: The age range of the shortlisted candidates is diverse, with candidates spanning from their 40s to their 50s. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: All successful candidates exhibit a high level of English proficiency, which is crucial given the predominantly English-speaking environment of the UNHRC. Spanish proficiency is not a requirement, and French is only minimally necessary, indicating that English fluency is the primary linguistic criterion.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process is balanced in terms of gender. The proportion of each gender is relatively equal, reflecting an inclusive approach that does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates hail from various Pacific and Oceanic regions, including New Zealand, Tonga, Samoa, and Australia. This diversity indicates that candidates from these regions are well-represented and potentially have an advantage due to their direct involvement with indigenous issues in the Pacific.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, particularly in terms of international law and human rights, appears to be a significant factor. Candidates with strong backgrounds in international law, indigenous rights, and human rights are more likely to be successful. This is evident from their educational backgrounds and professional experiences in these areas.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of educational locations is notable, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This suggests that a broad educational exposure, encompassing various legal and cultural contexts, is beneficial. Universities in countries like the UK, USA, Australia, and New Zealand are well-represented, indicating that these institutions provide a strong foundation for candidates in the field of indigenous rights and international law.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC exhibit a diverse range of ages, balanced gender representation, and come from various Pacific and Oceanic regions. They possess strong English language skills and have backgrounds in international law and human rights. The diversity in their educational experiences, spanning both OECD countries and the global south, further enhances their suitability for this mandate.
