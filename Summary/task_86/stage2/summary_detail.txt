The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) in the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide the selection process:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to fall within a mature age range, typically between 40 to 56 years old. This suggests that experience and a certain level of professional maturity are valued for this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all shortlisted candidates have high proficiency in this language. Other major languages like Spanish and French are not necessarily prerequisites, as indicated by the low or zero proficiency levels among some candidates.

3. **Gender Balance**: The summary does not provide information on the gender distribution among the shortlisted candidates. However, it is crucial to ensure a balanced representation of both genders to avoid any potential bias and to reflect diversity in the selection process.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from African states, particularly Nigeria and Ethiopia, are well-represented among the shortlisted candidates. This indicates a preference or a higher likelihood of success for candidates from these regions, possibly due to the relevance of their local experiences and perspectives to the mandate.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in human rights law and commercial law seem to have an advantage. The legal traditions associated with their education and professional experiences, particularly those related to international and African contexts, appear to be beneficial.

6. **Location of Education**: A diverse educational background, including institutions in both OECD countries and the global south, is evident among the successful candidates. This suggests that a broad educational exposure, encompassing different legal and cultural contexts, is advantageous.

In conclusion, the selection process for the EMRTD in the UNHRC appears to favor candidates who are mature professionals, fluent in English, and from specific African regions. They should have a robust background in relevant legal fields and a diverse educational experience that spans various global contexts. Ensuring a balanced gender representation and considering the relevance of the candidate's legal tradition and educational diversity are also key factors in the selection process.
