The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from African States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Legal and Academic Background**: All successful candidates possess a strong legal background, which is crucial for understanding and interpreting international human rights law, particularly in the context of the right to development. Additionally, their academic background indicates a deep understanding of theoretical and practical aspects of human rights and development issues.

2. **Proficiency in English**: Each of the successful candidates demonstrates a high level of proficiency in English, reflecting the language's importance in international diplomacy and the workings of the UNHRC. This proficiency ensures effective communication and participation in global discussions.

3. **Diverse Professional Experience**: The candidates have varied professional experiences, including roles in academia, government, and international organizations. This diversity of experience equips them with a broad perspective and the ability to navigate complex international environments, contributing effectively to the EMRTD's objectives.

4. **Relevance of Current Job**: The current job roles of the successful candidates are closely related to law and academia, which are directly relevant to the mandate of the EMRTD. This relevance ensures that they are actively engaged in areas that align with the council's focus on human rights and development.

5. **Age and Experience**: The age range of the successful candidates (spanning from the early 40s to late 50s) suggests a preference for individuals who have accumulated substantial experience and maturity in their fields, yet still possess the energy and adaptability required for dynamic international roles.

These key features collectively highlight the importance of a robust legal and academic foundation, language proficiency, diverse and relevant professional experiences, and a balance of age and experience in selecting candidates for the EMRTD in the UNHRC.
