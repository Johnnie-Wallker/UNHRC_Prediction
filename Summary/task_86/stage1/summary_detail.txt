The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) in the UN Human Rights Council reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, with ages spanning from the early 40s to late 50s. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all shortlisted candidates possess a high level of English proficiency. This indicates the importance of English as a working language in international human rights discussions.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This reflects an effort to ensure diversity and inclusivity in terms of gender representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from diverse African countries, highlighting the importance of regional representation from African states. This suggests that candidates from African countries may have a slight advantage, reflecting the mandate's focus on African perspectives and issues.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal backgrounds of the candidates vary, with some educated in common law systems and others in civil law systems. This diversity suggests that a broad legal education and understanding of different legal traditions are beneficial, rather than a specific legal background.

6. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including both within and outside Africa. This indicates that a diverse educational background, encompassing both global south and OECD countries, is valued. It underscores the importance of international exposure and understanding of global human rights frameworks.

In conclusion, the selection process for the EMRTD in the UN Human Rights Council favors candidates who are mature, possess strong English language skills, represent diverse African countries, have a broad legal education, and have studied in a variety of international settings. These factors collectively contribute to a well-rounded and capable expert mechanism.
