The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Bilingual or Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrated proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and either French or Spanish. This linguistic diversity is crucial for effectively communicating and coordinating across different regions and cultures affected by trafficking.

2. **Extensive Background in Relevant Fields**: All shortlisted candidates had backgrounds in legal, NGO, IGO, or government sectors. This indicates a strong preference for candidates with practical experience in human rights advocacy, policy-making, or legal frameworks related to trafficking.

3. **Current Engagement in Relevant Work**: The successful candidates are actively involved in roles that intersect with human rights, law, and governance. This includes positions in NGOs, IGOs, academia, and government, ensuring they are current in their understanding and application of anti-trafficking efforts.

4. **International Exposure and Experience**: Candidates with experience working in or with international organizations are favored. This international exposure is vital for navigating the complexities of global trafficking networks and for fostering international cooperation in addressing trafficking issues.

5. **Age and Maturity**: While age is not the sole determinant, the shortlisted candidates generally fall within the range of mid-career to late career, suggesting a preference for candidates who bring a depth of experience and maturity to the role.

These key features underscore the UNHRC's commitment to selecting candidates who not only have the necessary skills and knowledge but also the practical experience and international perspective required to effectively combat trafficking in persons, particularly focusing on women and children.
