The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are widely used in international forums and documentation. Proficiency in other relevant languages, such as Spanish or Arabic, can also be advantageous given the global nature of the mandate.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a mix of legal, academic, and international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds are favored. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of legal frameworks, academic research, and practical experience in international human rights mechanisms.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to human rights, law, or international governance. This includes positions in NGOs, governments, or academic institutions, reflecting active involvement in human rights advocacy and policy-making.

4. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, candidates with a mature age range (typically between 50 and 70) are considered, reflecting a balance of experience and continued energy to undertake the demanding role of a Special Rapporteur.

5. **Nationality and Cultural Diversity**: Candidates from diverse national backgrounds are preferred to ensure a global perspective and representation. This includes individuals from various regions such as Latin America, Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, reflecting the international scope of the mandate.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, ensuring that candidates are well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted issue of trafficking in persons, particularly focusing on women and children.
