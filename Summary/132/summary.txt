1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 50 to 100 years, indicating that both middle-aged and older candidates are considered successful. This suggests a trend towards valuing experience and maturity. In terms of language abilities, all successful candidates have high proficiency in English and Spanish, with varying levels in French. This indicates a preference for candidates with strong multilingual capabilities, particularly in English and Spanish, which are widely used in international forums.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both female and male individuals, with a slight majority being female (two females and one male). This suggests that there is no significant gender advantage in this selection process, and both genders are equally considered based on their qualifications and experience.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent a mix of nationalities, including Costa Rica, Spain, Mexico, and Chile. This diversity in nationality suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage. Instead, the selection seems to focus on the individual's qualifications and experience relevant to the role, regardless of their nationality.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions and educational institutions, ranging from civil law (e.g., Mexico, Costa Rica) to common law (e.g., Harvard University). This diversity indicates that the selection does not favor a specific legal tradition but rather values a broad range of legal and educational backgrounds that can contribute to the discussion on human rights and business enterprises.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (e.g., Harvard University, Universit¨¦ Catholique de Louvain) and universities in the global south (e.g., Universidad de Costa Rica, Universidad Aut¨®noma de Nuevo Le¨®n). This suggests that the location of education is not a decisive factor in the selection process. Instead, the quality of education, relevance of the program, and the candidate's performance and experience are more critical considerations.

In summary, the key features of successful candidates in this selection process include a strong multilingual capability, a diverse range of legal and educational backgrounds, significant professional experience in human rights and business enterprises, and a demonstrated ability to contribute to international discussions and initiatives. Age and gender do not appear to be significant factors, and there is no specific nationality or location of education that confers an advantage.
