1. **Age and Language Abilities:**
   - **Age Trend:** The successful candidates range in age from 34 to 63, indicating a mix of both younger and older professionals. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the energy and fresh perspective that younger candidates can bring.
   - **Language Abilities:** Most candidates have high English proficiency, which is crucial for international roles within the United Nations. Some candidates also possess high levels of Russian and French, which are important languages within the UN context. This diversity in language skills likely enhances their ability to communicate effectively across different regions and linguistic groups.

2. **Gender Advantage:**
   - The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating that there is no clear gender advantage in this selection. This reflects the UN's commitment to gender equality and the importance of diverse representation.

3. **Nationality Advantage:**
   - Candidates from various Eastern European states are represented, including Lithuania, Russia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Macedonia, and Croatia. This suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage, and the selection is based on individual qualifications and experiences rather than national origin.

4. **Legal Tradition:**
   - The candidates have diverse legal backgrounds, with education and experience in both civil law and common law traditions. For instance, candidates from Russia and Serbia have backgrounds in civil law, while those from Lithuania and Bosnia and Herzegovina have studied in mixed or common law environments. This diversity in legal traditions likely contributes to a broader understanding and approach to human rights issues.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity:**
   - The candidates have studied in various locations, including Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and the United States. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that international exposure and a broad educational foundation are valued. Candidates who have studied in both OECD countries and the global south demonstrate a well-rounded perspective, which is likely beneficial for addressing global human rights issues.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a mix of ages, language abilities, and nationalities, reflecting a balanced and diverse selection process. Gender does not appear to be a determining factor, and the diversity in legal traditions and educational backgrounds enhances the candidates' suitability for addressing complex human rights issues within the UN framework.
