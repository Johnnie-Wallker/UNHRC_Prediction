1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates span a wide age range, indicating that both younger and older professionals are considered.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates demonstrating proficiency in multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, and others. This suggests that multilingualism is valued but not a strict requirement.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both male and female professionals, indicating that gender is not a determining factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Argentina, Guatemala, France, and Singapore. This suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, and the selection is based on merit and qualifications rather than nationality.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have been educated and have worked in various legal traditions, including civil law, common law, and international law. This diversity in legal backgrounds indicates that a broad range of legal expertise is valued, and candidates are selected based on their qualifications and experience rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries and the global south, including universities in the United States, France, China, and Singapore. This suggests that the location and diversity of education are not limiting factors; rather, the quality of education and the relevance of the candidate's expertise are more critical.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers appears to be merit-based, considering a wide range of factors including age, language abilities, gender, nationality, legal tradition, and the location and diversity of education. There is no single trend or advantage that dominates the selection, reflecting a holistic and inclusive approach to identifying the most suitable candidates.
