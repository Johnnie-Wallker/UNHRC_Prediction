1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates (7cce53, 53c041, 456ac9) range in age from 31 to 44, indicating a preference for candidates in their prime working years. Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with proficiency in English and other languages like French and Spanish, suggesting that multilingualism is valued but not a strict requirement.

2. **Gender**: The shortlisted candidates are all female, indicating a potential gender bias towards selecting female candidates. This could reflect a preference for gender diversity or specific qualities associated with female candidates in this context.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent a mix of nationalities (United States, Germany), suggesting that nationality is not a decisive factor. However, all candidates are from Western European and other States, aligning with the group's geographical focus.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The legal traditions of the successful candidates vary, with backgrounds in international law, human rights, and public administration. This diversity suggests that a broad legal and human rights background is beneficial, rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. This indicates that the location of education, whether in OECD countries or the global south, is not a limiting factor. Instead, the quality and relevance of the education, particularly in human rights and international law, seem to be more critical.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages and language abilities, are predominantly female, represent diverse nationalities within the specified region, have varied legal backgrounds, and have studied in different geographical locations. These factors collectively contribute to their suitability for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent.
