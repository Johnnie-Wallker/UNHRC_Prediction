1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 52 to 69, indicating a preference for candidates with significant experience and maturity. All successful candidates possess high proficiency in English and French, with varying levels in other languages (Spanish in one case, intermediate in another). This suggests a trend towards candidates with strong multilingual abilities, particularly in widely used international languages.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include two women and one man, indicating no clear gender bias in the selection process. Both genders are represented among the successful candidates, suggesting that qualifications and experience are prioritized over gender.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates are from Belgium and Italy, both Western European countries. This could indicate a slight advantage for candidates from Western European states, possibly due to familiarity with the European legal and political systems, or a higher representation of these countries in international organizations.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal traditions seem to align with international and European legal frameworks, as evidenced by their educational backgrounds and professional experiences in international law, EU policies, and public international law. This suggests that candidates with a background in international or European legal traditions are more likely to be successful, reflecting the international and regional focus of the EMRTD.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have been educated in various prestigious institutions, including universities in OECD countries like Italy, Belgium, and the United States (Cornell University). This diversity in educational backgrounds, including both Western and European institutions, suggests that a broad and internationally recognized education is valued, rather than a specific geographic or economic bloc focus.

In summary, the successful candidates for the EMRTD position exhibit a range of ages and gender diversity, with strong multilingual capabilities. They predominantly come from Western European countries and have backgrounds in international or European legal traditions. Their educational backgrounds are diverse, encompassing both OECD countries and prominent international institutions, indicating a preference for candidates with a broad and internationally recognized education.
