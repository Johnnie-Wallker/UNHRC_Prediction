1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates (1b1132, f0f6ba, e92d74) range in age from 39 to 48, indicating a preference for candidates in their 40s. This suggests a trend towards selecting individuals who are likely to have accumulated substantial experience and expertise without being too close to retirement age. In terms of language abilities, all successful candidates have a high level of English proficiency, which is crucial for international roles within the UN. Two of them also have high proficiency in Chinese, which aligns with the strategic importance of China in the Asia-Pacific region.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include two males (f0f6ba, e92d74) and one female (1b1132). This balanced representation suggests that gender was not a decisive factor in the selection process, aligning with the UN's commitment to gender equality.

3. **Nationality**: Two of the successful candidates are from China (f0f6ba, 1b1132) and one from India (e92d74). This indicates a slight advantage for candidates from China, possibly reflecting the geopolitical influence and the growing importance of China in global governance and human rights discourse.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have strong backgrounds in international law and human rights, with significant experience in both academic and practical legal settings. This suggests that a solid grounding in international legal traditions, particularly in human rights, is highly advantageous. The diversity in their legal education and experience, spanning from China to the United States and India, indicates a preference for candidates with a broad understanding of different legal systems and international frameworks.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including China, India, the United States, and Europe (Norway, Harvard Law School). This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the selection committee values exposure to different educational systems and international perspectives. The inclusion of institutions from both OECD countries and the global south indicates a balanced approach to educational diversity.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development demonstrate a range of desirable attributes, including mid-career experience, high proficiency in English, a strong background in international law and human rights, and diverse educational experiences across different regions. Nationality and gender do not appear to be decisive factors, although there is a slight preference for candidates from China.
