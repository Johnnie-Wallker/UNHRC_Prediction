1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, with ages spanning from the mid-40s to late 70s. This suggests that experience and maturity are highly valued, but there is no strict age limit for suitability.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, particularly English, French, and Spanish. This multilingual proficiency is crucial for effectively engaging with diverse stakeholders and understanding various legal contexts within the mandate.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates are predominantly male, indicating a potential gender bias in the selection process. This disproportion could reflect underlying biases or preferences in the selection criteria.

4. **Nationality and Region**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Western Europe and North America. This diversity in nationality suggests that a broad geographical representation is valued, but certain regions may still have a slight advantage due to historical involvement and expertise in human rights issues.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong foundation in international law, regardless of their legal tradition, seem to have an advantage. This includes those educated in both civil law and common law systems, indicating a preference for candidates with a versatile understanding of different legal frameworks.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south, are favored. This suggests that a varied educational background, reflecting exposure to different legal and cultural contexts, is considered beneficial for the mandate.

In summary, the selection process for the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances within the UNHRC values candidates with extensive experience, multilingual abilities, and a diverse educational background. While there is a noticeable bias towards male candidates, the selection also emphasizes the importance of geographical diversity and a broad understanding of various legal traditions.
