Based on the information provided, the following key features of successful candidates for the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances in the UNHRC can be summarized:

1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 41 to 77 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit or preference.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in major international languages. All candidates listed have high proficiency in English and French, which are key languages in international diplomacy and human rights discourse. Spanish proficiency, while present, is less uniformly high, indicating that while beneficial, it may not be a strict requirement.

3. **Gender Balance**: The summary does not provide information on the gender of the candidates, so it is not possible to assess any gender bias or preference in the selection process based on the given data.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Canada, Spain, and the United Kingdom. This suggests that a global perspective and representation are valued, and there is no specific regional or national bias.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' educational backgrounds reflect a mix of civil law and common law traditions, with studies conducted in various countries including Canada, Chile, Ecuador, and the United Kingdom. This diversity in legal education suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems enhances a candidate's suitability for international human rights roles.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: The candidates have studied in a variety of locations, including both OECD countries and global south nations. This diversity in educational settings is likely seen as advantageous, reflecting a global perspective and understanding of human rights issues across different socio-cultural contexts.

In summary, successful candidates for the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances in the UNHRC are characterized by their diverse educational backgrounds, proficiency in major international languages, and a broad understanding of different legal traditions.
