Based on the information provided, the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in the United Nations Human Rights Council can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Trend**: The candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 41 to 61 years old. This suggests that extensive experience in the field is valued, but there is no strict age limit or preference.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically fluent in English, which is a critical requirement given the global nature of the UNHRC. Some candidates also possess proficiency in other major languages such as French and Spanish, indicating a potential advantage for candidates with multilingual abilities.

3. **Gender Balance**: The information provided does not indicate a significant gender bias. The candidates are all female, suggesting that while gender balance is important, the selection is merit-based and not skewed towards one gender.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The candidates represent diverse nationalities, including Turkey, the United States, and Germany. This indicates that there is no specific regional or national advantage, and the selection process values diversity and global representation.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including European, American, and international law. This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is beneficial, but not exclusively tied to one legal tradition.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates have received education in diverse locations, including universities in OECD countries (e.g., the United States) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Turkey and Morocco). This indicates that a diverse educational background is valued, reflecting a global perspective and understanding of different legal and socio-economic contexts.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the right to food emphasizes candidates with extensive experience, multilingual abilities, and a diverse educational and professional background. Age, gender, and nationality are not limiting factors, but rather, the selection values diversity and a broad understanding of global legal and human rights issues.
