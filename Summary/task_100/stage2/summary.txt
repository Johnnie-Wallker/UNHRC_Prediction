The successful candidates for the position of Special Rapporteur on the right to food in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Bilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and documentation within the international framework of the UN. Additionally, some candidates possess intermediate to low levels of proficiency in other major languages, such as French and Spanish, enhancing their ability to engage with a broader range of stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates have a robust mix of professional experiences, including legal, academic, and organizational backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of the legal frameworks, academic research, and practical implementation of food rights initiatives.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are closely related to law and academia or non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This indicates their active involvement and commitment to ongoing issues related to human rights, particularly in the context of food security.

4. **International Exposure**: Candidates with backgrounds in international governmental organizations (IGOs) or those who are citizens of multiple countries show a significant advantage in understanding and navigating the complexities of international law and diplomacy.

5. **Age Diversity**: The age range of the candidates, from 41 to 61, suggests a balance between seasoned experience and energetic engagement, which is beneficial for the dynamic and demanding role of a Special Rapporteur.

These key features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes within the UNHRC, emphasizing the need for multilingual proficiency, diverse and relevant professional experiences, active engagement in human rights-related fields, and a demonstrated capacity to operate effectively in an international context.
