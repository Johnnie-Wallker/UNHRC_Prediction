The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to food in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Multifaceted Background**: Successful candidates possess a diverse background that includes legal expertise, complemented by experience in academic, international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and possibly corporate settings. This multifaceted experience ensures a broad understanding and ability to navigate various aspects of human rights, particularly in the context of food rights.

2. **Language Proficiency**: High proficiency in English is a common trait among successful candidates, reflecting the global nature of the UNHRC and the need for effective communication across different nations and cultures. Additionally, proficiency in other major languages such as Spanish can be advantageous, enhancing the candidate's ability to engage with a wider audience and understand diverse perspectives.

3. **Relevant Current Job**: The successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are closely related to law and often involve academic research, advocacy, or policy-making within international or non-governmental contexts. This indicates a strong alignment with the practical aspects of the Special Rapporteur role, including the ability to influence policy and contribute to scholarly discourse.

4. **International Perspective**: While not all successful candidates have dual citizenship, the inclusion of candidates with international backgrounds or experiences suggests a preference for individuals who can bring a global perspective to the role. This is crucial for addressing the international scope of food rights issues and for fostering cooperation among diverse stakeholders.

5. **Age Diversity**: The shortlisted candidates span a range of ages, indicating that both seasoned professionals and those with a slightly younger perspective are valued. This diversity in age can bring a balance of experience and innovative approaches to the role.

These key features highlight the importance of a candidate's comprehensive background, linguistic abilities, current professional alignment, international outlook, and a mix of experience levels in the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the right to food at the UNHRC.
