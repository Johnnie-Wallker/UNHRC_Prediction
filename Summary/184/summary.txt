1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 31 to 62, indicating that both younger and older professionals are considered for the role.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with proficiency in English being common, and some candidates also possessing high levels of Spanish. This suggests that language proficiency, particularly in English, is valued, but not necessarily a limiting factor if other qualifications are strong.

   - The successful candidates include both male and female professionals, indicating no clear gender advantage in this selection.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Colombia, Chile, Palestine, Ireland, and New Zealand. This suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage; rather, a broad international perspective is valued.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have educational backgrounds and professional experiences that span various legal traditions, including international law, human rights law, and disability rights. This diversity in legal traditions suggests that a broad understanding and experience in multiple legal frameworks are advantageous.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:

Diversity in legal traditions and educational experiences, both geographically and in content, appears to be highly valued.
