1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, from 63 to an unknown age, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, all successful candidates demonstrate strong language abilities, particularly in English, French, and Spanish, which are crucial for international diplomacy and communication within the UN framework.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female representatives, suggesting that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Saint Lucia, Peru, Guatemala, Uruguay, and Argentina), indicating that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage. This diversity reflects the UN's commitment to inclusivity and representation from various regions.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition does not appear to be a decisive factor. Successful candidates have backgrounds in various fields including law, social sciences, and international relations. Their success seems more linked to their expertise in indigenous rights, international law, and human rights, rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident among the successful candidates. They have studied in various countries including France, Peru, Guatemala, Uruguay, and Argentina, reflecting a mix of OECD countries and global south institutions. This suggests that the relevance and quality of education, rather than the geographic location, are more critical factors.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) demonstrate a strong command of international languages, diverse educational backgrounds, and expertise in relevant fields such as human rights, international law, and indigenous rights. The selection process values expertise and experience in indigenous rights and international cooperation, rather than specific demographic or educational location biases.
