The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from Asia-Pacific States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features can serve as clear guidelines for future candidate selection processes:

1. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates possess a blend of legal, academic, and governmental backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and application of human rights principles within various contexts, including international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private companies.

2. **Strong Academic and Legal Expertise**: All successful candidates have a robust academic background coupled with legal expertise. This combination is crucial for addressing complex human rights issues and contributing effectively to the development and implementation of policies and frameworks related to the right to development.

3. **Broad Experience in Human Rights Institutions**: Candidates who have worked in multiple human rights-related institutions, such as IGOs, NGOs, and government bodies, are favored. This experience provides a practical understanding of the operational challenges and opportunities in advancing the right to development.

4. **Proficiency in English**: High proficiency in English is a critical requirement, as it is the primary working language in the UNHRC. This proficiency ensures effective communication and collaboration among international stakeholders.

5. **Relevant Current Job Roles**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to academia and law, often involving government or IGO participation. This relevance ensures that they are actively involved in contemporary human rights issues and are well-positioned to contribute to the EMRTD's objectives.

6. **Age and Experience Balance**: The age range of the successful candidates (mid-30s to late 40s) suggests a preference for individuals who have accumulated sufficient experience without being too far advanced in their careers. This balance ensures a mix of seasoned expertise and continued energy and commitment to the role.

These key features provide a clear and specific framework for evaluating and selecting candidates for the EMRTD in future UNHRC meetings, ensuring that the chosen individuals are well-equipped to address the complex and evolving challenges related to the right to development.
