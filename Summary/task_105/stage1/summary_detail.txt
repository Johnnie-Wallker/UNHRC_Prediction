1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with successful candidates aged between 36 and 70. This suggests that experience and maturity, as well as fresh perspectives from younger candidates, are valued.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English and often in French as well. Some candidates also possess proficiency in Arabic and other languages, indicating that multilingualism is advantageous, especially in a global role that involves interaction with diverse regions and cultures.

This diversity reflects the global nature of the mandate and the need for a broad understanding of environmental and human rights issues across different contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a background in international law, human rights, and environmental law are more likely to be successful. The legal tradition, particularly in international and comparative law, seems to be a significant factor, as it aligns with the mandate's focus on global environmental governance and human rights.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have received education in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the UNHRC values exposure to different legal and cultural environments, which can enhance the candidate's ability to address complex, cross-border issues.
