These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are the working languages of the UN. Proficiency in Arabic is also beneficial given the geographical context of many countries dealing with hazardous substances and wastes.

2. **Broad Background in Relevant Fields**: Candidates possess a diverse background that includes legal, academic, and government experience. This multidisciplinary background ensures a comprehensive understanding of both the legal frameworks and the practical challenges associated with environmental management and human rights.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are closely related to the mandate. These roles include academic and law-related positions, as well as work within NGOs, which provide direct experience in advocating for and implementing policies related to environmental protection and human rights.

4. **Geographical Representation**: The candidates represent a diverse range of countries, which is crucial for ensuring that the Special Rapporteur can effectively address the global nature of the issues related to hazardous substances and wastes.

5. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, the presence of candidates with a range of ages and levels of experience ensures a balance between seasoned expertise and fresh perspectives.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the need for candidates who are well-versed in relevant languages, possess a strong and varied background in pertinent fields, are currently active in relevant roles, and represent diverse geographical areas. This approach ensures that the selected Special Rapporteur is well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted issues associated with the mandate.
