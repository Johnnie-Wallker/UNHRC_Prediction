1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates show a mix in age, ranging from 33 to 81 years old, indicating that both younger and older candidates are considered.
   - Language abilities are diverse but generally high, with candidates proficient in multiple languages including English, French, Arabic, and others. This suggests that multilingualism is valued.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating no clear gender bias in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Algeria, Spain, Greece, Belarus, Zambia), suggesting that no single nationality has a distinct advantage.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates' legal traditions vary widely, with education and experience spanning different legal systems (common law, civil law, etc.). This diversity suggests that a broad understanding of various legal traditions is beneficial but not exclusively decisive.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The education of successful candidates is spread across various regions, including both OECD countries (e.g., Oxford, Harvard, Yale) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Belarusian State University, University of Zambia). This indicates that both global north and south educational backgrounds are considered valuable, emphasizing a preference for diverse educational experiences.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights demonstrate a preference for candidates with diverse backgrounds, high language proficiency, and a broad understanding of different legal traditions. Age, gender, and nationality do not appear to be decisive factors, and educational diversity is highly valued.
