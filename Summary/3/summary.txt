1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates' ages range from 44 to 74, indicating a diverse age group.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are varied, with some having high proficiency in multiple languages (English, French, Spanish) and others having lower proficiency in certain languages. This suggests that while language proficiency is important, it is not the sole determinant of success.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating that gender does not appear to be a significant factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from a mix of countries, including Spain, Bangladesh, Austria, Argentina, and the United States. This diversity suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage over others.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (U.S., U.K.), civil law (Spain, Argentina), and mixed systems (Austria). This indicates that familiarity with different legal traditions is valued, reflecting the international nature of the role.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (U.S., U.K., Austria) and non-OECD countries (Argentina, Bangladesh). This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the location and diversity of education are considered valuable attributes, reflecting the international scope of the role.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a diverse range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, legal traditions, and educational backgrounds. This diversity underscores the importance of a broad and inclusive approach to selecting candidates for an international role such as the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence.
