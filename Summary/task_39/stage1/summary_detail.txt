1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with the youngest being 48 years old and the oldest being 73 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for the role of Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic People¡¯s Republic of Korea.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is consistent across all shortlisted candidates. Additionally, several candidates also possess intermediate or high levels of proficiency in other major languages such as French, Arabic, and Russian, indicating that multilingualism is a beneficial trait but English fluency is essential.

3. **Gender Representation**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process does not inherently favor one gender over the other, promoting gender equality in the selection for this mandate.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Austria, United States, Bangladesh, Thailand, Poland, and Peru. This diversity indicates that there is no specific regional or national advantage, emphasizing the importance of global perspectives and experiences in the role.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal traditions vary widely, with education backgrounds from countries following different legal systems (e.g., civil law, common law). This diversity in legal traditions suggests that a broad understanding of various legal frameworks is valued, rather than a specific legal background.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the candidates spans across various regions, including both OECD countries and the global south. This indicates that the diversity in educational backgrounds, reflecting different legal and cultural contexts, is considered advantageous, promoting a comprehensive understanding of global human rights issues.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic People¡¯s Republic of Korea emphasize a broad range of experiences, multilingual capabilities, gender equality, and diverse legal and educational backgrounds to ensure a well-rounded and globally informed approach to human rights advocacy.
