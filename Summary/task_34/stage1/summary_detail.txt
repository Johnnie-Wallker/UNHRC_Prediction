1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 exhibit a broad age range, with candidates aged from the mid-40s to the late 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for suitability.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English and often have additional language skills, such as French, Arabic, and Spanish. This indicates that fluency in major international languages, particularly those relevant to the region and global diplomatic contexts, is advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced representation in terms of gender. This suggests that the selection process is inclusive and does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, and other countries. This diversity reflects the global nature of the UNHRC and the importance of having a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law, human rights law, and experience in international tribunals or human rights organizations are more likely to be successful. The legal tradition, particularly in international and comparative law, seems to be a significant factor.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries and global south institutions, are represented among the shortlisted candidates. This suggests that a diverse educational background, encompassing different legal and cultural traditions, is valued.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role emphasizes a broad range of experience, language proficiency in major international languages, gender balance, and a diverse educational and national background. Candidates with a strong grounding in international and human rights law, regardless of their specific legal tradition or the location of their education, are more likely to be successful.
