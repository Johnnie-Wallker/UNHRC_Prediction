The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several important trends and characteristics:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the mid-40s to the mid-60s. This suggests that extensive experience in the field of human rights, which typically accumulates over many years, is highly valued.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is consistently high among the successful candidates, reflecting its global use in international law and diplomacy. Additionally, proficiency in Arabic is also notable, given the mandate's focus on the Palestinian territories. Other languages, such as French and Spanish, are present but to a lesser extent, indicating that while not mandatory, multilingualism is advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates are exclusively female, which could indicate a current trend or preference for female candidates in this specific role within the UNHRC. This gender concentration might reflect specific organizational needs or priorities.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse regions, including the United States, Italy, and Australia, are represented. This suggests a preference for global representation, although the exact distribution of nationalities among the successful candidates is not uniform, indicating that certain regions might still have a slight advantage.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The educational backgrounds of the candidates are predominantly rooted in common law and civil law traditions, reflecting a broad international legal education. This diversity in legal traditions suggests that a well-rounded understanding of different legal systems enhances a candidate's suitability for the role.

6. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in various locations globally, including North America, Europe, and the Middle East. This diversity in educational settings indicates that a broad international exposure, encompassing both OECD countries and the global south, is beneficial. It suggests that the UNHRC values candidates who have experienced different educational and cultural environments, which can enrich their perspectives and approaches to human rights issues.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC appears to favor candidates with extensive experience, multilingual capabilities, and a diverse educational background across different legal traditions and geographical regions. The current trend towards selecting female candidates and the specific emphasis on English and Arabic proficiency are also notable.
