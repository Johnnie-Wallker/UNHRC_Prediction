Based on the provided information, the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus in the United Nations Human Rights Council can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Trend**: The candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the early 50s to the 70s. This suggests that extensive experience and maturity are valued attributes for this role, rather than a specific age bracket.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically multilingual, with proficiency in English, French, and Russian being common. Spanish proficiency varies, with some candidates having minimal to moderate skills. This indicates that fluency in major international languages, particularly those relevant to the region and global diplomacy, is crucial.

3. **Gender Balance**: The sample includes both male and female candidates, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates is not provided, but the inclusion of both genders indicates a balanced approach.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from various European countries (France, Romania, United Kingdom) are represented. This suggests that while European candidates are well-represented, there is no exclusive regional bias. The diversity in nationalities indicates a preference for a global perspective, though European backgrounds seem prevalent.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, based on nationality and possibly education, does not appear to be a decisive factor. Candidates with backgrounds in international law and policy, as evidenced by their roles in international organizations and academic institutions, are successful, regardless of the specific legal tradition they may be associated with.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of educational backgrounds is not explicitly mentioned, but the candidates' extensive experience in international roles suggests that a broad educational foundation, possibly including studies in various international settings, is beneficial. The focus on international relations and policy indicates that education in relevant fields is advantageous.

In summary, successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur role are characterized by their extensive international experience, multilingual capabilities, balanced gender representation, and diverse national backgrounds. Their qualifications are rooted in international law, policy, and diplomacy, with a strong emphasis on practical experience in global human rights and security issues.
