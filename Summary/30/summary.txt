   - **Age**: The successful candidates range in age from 30 to 61, indicating that both younger and more experienced professionals are considered. There is no clear age trend, suggesting a diversity in age preferences.
   - **Language Abilities**: High proficiency in English and Spanish is common among the successful candidates. This suggests that strong language skills in widely spoken languages are advantageous.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating no clear gender advantage. Gender diversity is represented in the shortlisted candidates.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse countries including Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Guyana, and the United States. This suggests no specific nationality has an advantage; rather, a diverse representation of countries is valued.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The legal tradition does not seem to be a decisive factor. Candidates have backgrounds in various fields such as law, international affairs, anthropology, and education. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that a wide range of legal and non-legal expertise is considered valuable.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The location of education is diverse, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries (e.g., United States, United Kingdom) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Brazil, Colombia, Mexico). This suggests that both international and local educational experiences are valued, emphasizing the importance of diverse perspectives and experiences rather than the specific location of education.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a diversity in age, gender, nationality, and educational backgrounds. Strong language skills, particularly in English and Spanish, are advantageous. There is no clear advantage based on gender or nationality, and both international and local educational experiences are valued.
