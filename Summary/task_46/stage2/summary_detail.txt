1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, with individuals aged from the late 30s to the mid-60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the inclusion of younger perspectives.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is consistent across all shortlisted candidates. Some candidates also possess intermediate to high levels of proficiency in other major languages such as French and Chinese, indicating that multilingualism is an advantageous trait.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This indicates that the selection process is inclusive of both genders, and neither gender holds a distinct advantage based on the provided data.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including China, Philippines, Bangladesh, and Nepal. This diversity suggests that the selection process values representation from various regions within Asia, ensuring a broad perspective and understanding of indigenous rights issues across different cultural and legal contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in law, particularly international law, seem to have an advantage. This is evident from the educational and professional backgrounds of several shortlisted candidates, who have either studied or specialized in international law, reflecting the legal complexities inherent in indigenous rights issues.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is notable, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This suggests that a broad educational exposure, encompassing different legal and cultural traditions, is beneficial. Candidates who have studied in multiple regions or internationally are more likely to bring a comprehensive understanding of global indigenous rights issues.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC favor candidates who are multilingual, have a balanced gender representation, come from diverse national and regional backgrounds, possess strong legal backgrounds, and have a varied educational experience across different global contexts.
