The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC reveals several trends and preferences in the selection process:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, indicating that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively. The age range spans from the early 30s to the late 60s, suggesting a preference for candidates who have accumulated substantial professional experience across different stages of their careers.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple languages, with a strong emphasis on English and French, which are common languages in international diplomacy and human rights discourse. Many candidates also possess proficiency in Arabic, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the regions they represent.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to maintain a balanced representation of both genders. While specific proportions are not detailed, the presence of both male and female candidates in the shortlist indicates a commitment to gender equality in the selection criteria.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse regions, particularly from Africa, are well-represented. This suggests a preference for regional diversity to ensure a broad understanding and representation of indigenous issues across different geographical contexts. Countries like Algeria, Kenya, and Uganda have multiple representatives, highlighting their significance in the indigenous rights landscape.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a background in international law, human rights law, and peace studies are prevalent. This indicates a strong preference for candidates who are well-versed in legal frameworks relevant to indigenous rights and international human rights standards. The legal tradition, often shaped by the location of education and professional experience, plays a crucial role in the selection.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in diverse geographical locations, including both OECD countries and global south institutions, are successful. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests a value placed on global perspectives and the ability to navigate and contribute to international dialogues effectively.

In conclusion, the selection process for EMRIP members in the UNHRC favors candidates who demonstrate a blend of professional experience, linguistic proficiency, gender balance, regional diversity, and a strong grounding in relevant legal traditions and educational diversity. These criteria ensure a robust and representative body capable of addressing the complex issues surrounding indigenous rights globally.
