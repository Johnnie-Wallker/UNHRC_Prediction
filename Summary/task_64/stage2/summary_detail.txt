1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from Africa in the UNHRC exhibit a wide age range, with individuals aged from the early 30s to the mid-60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the inclusion of younger perspectives.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English and French, which are major languages in international diplomacy and human rights discourse. Some candidates also demonstrate proficiency in Arabic, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the African continent.

3. **Gender Representation**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced representation of gender. This suggests that the selection process is inclusive and does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse African countries, including Algeria, Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have been shortlisted. This diversity reflects the broad representation of the African continent, ensuring that various regional perspectives are considered.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in law, particularly those educated in international human rights law, have a notable presence among the shortlisted individuals. This indicates that a strong legal background, especially in human rights, is advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of successful candidates is spread across various regions, including Africa, Europe, and North America. This diversity in educational locations suggests that exposure to different legal and cultural environments is beneficial, and candidates who have studied both within and outside their home regions are well-regarded.

In summary, the selection process for EMRIP members from Africa in the UNHRC values a diverse range of ages, balanced gender representation, linguistic proficiency in major international languages, and a broad representation of nationalities and educational backgrounds. Candidates with strong legal backgrounds in human rights, particularly those with international exposure, are more likely to be successful.
