1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, suggesting that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively so. The candidates' ages span from the early 40s to the late 60s, indicating a preference for candidates who have accumulated substantial professional experience without being overly restrictive on age.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, particularly English and French, which are common among the shortlisted candidates. High proficiency in these languages is crucial for effective communication and negotiation within the international arena of the UNHRC.

3. **Gender Representation**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced approach to gender representation. This suggests that the selection process is striving to be inclusive and equitable, recognizing the importance of diverse perspectives in fulfilling the mandate of the Special Rapporteur.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse geographical regions, including Europe, Latin America, and Africa. This diversity reflects the global nature of the UNHRC and the need for a broad understanding of human rights issues across different cultural and legal contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law and civil law, have been successful. This indicates that a broad legal education and understanding are beneficial, as the role of the Special Rapporteur often involves navigating and interpreting different legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have often received education in both OECD countries and global south regions. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that a broad exposure to different legal and cultural environments is highly valued, enabling the candidates to address human rights issues with a comprehensive and inclusive perspective.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers at the UNHRC favors candidates with a broad range of experience, multilingual abilities, balanced gender representation, and diverse educational and legal backgrounds. This approach ensures that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address the complex and varied challenges associated with promoting and protecting judicial independence and the rule of law globally.
