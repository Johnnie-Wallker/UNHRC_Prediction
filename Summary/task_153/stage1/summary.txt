The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for the candidate selection process:

1. **Strong Legal Background**: All successful candidates possess a robust legal background, which is essential for understanding and addressing issues related to judicial independence and the role of lawyers. This background equips them with the necessary expertise to navigate complex legal frameworks and advocate for reforms.

2. **Multifaceted Experience**: Successful candidates have demonstrated experience across various sectors, including government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international governmental organizations (IGOs), and academia. This diverse experience ensures a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in promoting judicial independence.

3. **Bilingual or Multilingual Proficiency**: Candidates who are proficient in multiple languages, particularly English and French, are favored. This linguistic diversity is crucial for effective communication and engagement with stakeholders from different linguistic backgrounds, enhancing the Special Rapporteur's ability to operate globally.

4. **Active Engagement in Current Relevant Roles**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to law, governance, or human rights. This active involvement ensures that they are up-to-date with contemporary issues and can bring practical insights and solutions to the mandate.

5. **Age and Maturity**: While age is not a definitive factor, candidates with a mix of youth and experience are considered. This balance allows for a blend of fresh perspectives and seasoned judgment, which is beneficial for the dynamic and challenging role of the Special Rapporteur.

6. **International Exposure**: Candidates with international experience, either through dual citizenship, work in multiple countries, or engagement with international bodies, are preferred. This exposure enhances their ability to navigate global contexts and build networks essential for the mandate's success.

These key features provide a clear and structured approach to selecting candidates who are well-equipped to fulfill the responsibilities of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers within the UNHRC.
