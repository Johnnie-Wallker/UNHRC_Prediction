1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers exhibit a wide age range, with candidates aged from the late 30s to the early 70s. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English, which is a common requirement given its widespread use in international legal and diplomatic contexts. Additionally, fluency in French is also seen as advantageous, reflecting its importance in international law and diplomacy. Spanish proficiency is less uniformly required, with varying levels among the candidates.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be balanced, reinforcing the UNHRC's commitment to gender equality in professional roles.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, spanning various regions including Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia. This diversity underscores the importance of global representation and the recognition that expertise in human rights and judicial independence can be found across different cultures and legal systems.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in different legal traditions, including common law and civil law systems, have been successful. This suggests that a broad understanding of various legal frameworks is beneficial, reflecting the international nature of the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates have been educated in a variety of locations, including both OECD countries and global south nations. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UNHRC values exposure to different legal and cultural environments, enhancing the candidates' ability to address issues of judicial independence and human rights comprehensively.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Special Rapporteur position emphasize a broad range of experiences, language proficiency in major international languages, gender balance, and a diverse educational and professional background. This approach ensures that the selected candidate is well-equipped to address the complex and global challenges related to judicial independence and human rights.
