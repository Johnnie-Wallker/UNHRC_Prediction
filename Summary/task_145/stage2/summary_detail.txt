Based on the provided information, the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to education in the United Nations Human Rights Council can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 41 to 72 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, including English and French, which are widely used in international human rights discourse. Some candidates also possess proficiency in additional languages such as Chinese and Spanish, indicating a trend towards multilingualism.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process is relatively balanced in terms of gender. However, the exact proportions are not provided, so a more detailed analysis would be needed to confirm the absence of gender bias.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Europe (Greece, Belgium, Italy), Africa (Burkina Faso), and Asia (China). This indicates a preference for global representation and the importance of diverse perspectives in addressing education rights issues globally.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law and human rights, regardless of their legal tradition, seem to have an advantage. This includes those educated in both civil law and common law traditions, as well as those with a background in canon law.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have been educated in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the selection committee values exposure to different educational systems and legal frameworks, enhancing the candidates' ability to address global education rights issues.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the right to education values candidates who are experienced, multilingual, and representative of diverse regions and legal traditions. The educational background should reflect a broad exposure to different educational systems and legal frameworks.
