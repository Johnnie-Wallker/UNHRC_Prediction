1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates (d2ddea, fbd793, ad61ab) range in age from 42 to 62, indicating a preference for more experienced professionals.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with d2ddea having high proficiency in English, French, and Spanish, and ad61ab also having high proficiency in English, French, and Spanish. fbd793, being a female candidate, has high proficiency in Spanish. This suggests that multilingualism is valued, especially in English, French, and Spanish.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both male and female (d2ddea, fbd793, ad61ab). This indicates that gender does not appear to be a decisive factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Brazil/Portugal, Argentina/Spain, Peru). This suggests that a broad representation of Latin American and Caribbean States is valued, and no single nationality has a distinct advantage.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in various legal traditions, including international law, human rights law, and European law. This diversity in legal education suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems and traditions is beneficial, rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (e.g., Belgium, Switzerland, France) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Peru). This indicates that the diversity of educational locations is valued, reflecting a global perspective and understanding of international law and human rights.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) in the United Nations Human Rights Council demonstrate a preference for experienced professionals with diverse linguistic abilities, a broad range of legal traditions, and educational backgrounds from both OECD and non-OECD countries. Gender and specific nationalities do not appear to be decisive factors in the selection process.
