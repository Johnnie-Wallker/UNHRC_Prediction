1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates (db1915, 253f7b, bc7316, 42d6c7, 3fb451) range in age from 38 to 64, indicating a preference for experience rather than a specific age bracket.
   - Language abilities are diverse but generally high in English, with some candidates proficient in multiple languages (e.g., French, Arabic). This suggests that while English proficiency is crucial, multilingualism is also valued.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women (3 males: db1915, 253f7b, bc7316; 2 females: 42d6c7, 3fb451), indicating no clear gender bias in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (India, Chad/USA, UK, Philippines, Canada), suggesting no specific nationality advantage. However, representation from both global north and south is evident, which may reflect a balanced approach to global perspectives.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates' legal traditions vary, with backgrounds in common law (UK, Canada), civil law (India, Chad/USA, Philippines), and mixed systems. This diversity suggests that familiarity with different legal traditions is beneficial but not decisive.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - Education locations are diverse, including institutions in OECD countries (e.g., USA, UK, Canada) and non-OECD countries (e.g., India, Chad, Philippines). This indicates that both local and international educational experiences are valued, reflecting a need for understanding diverse contexts and global perspectives.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, language abilities, and educational backgrounds, with no clear gender or nationality bias. The diversity in legal traditions and educational locations suggests a preference for candidates who can bring a broad and inclusive perspective to the role of Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons.
