The successful candidates for the Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises within the Western European and other States category at the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates possess a blend of legal, academic, and practical backgrounds. This diversity includes experience in international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government sectors, and private companies. This broad range of experience ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to addressing human rights issues related to transnational corporations.

2. **Multilingual Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a must, candidates with additional language skills, particularly French and Spanish, are favored. This linguistic diversity is crucial for effective communication and collaboration within the international arena, especially considering the geographical focus of Western European and other States.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently engaged in academic and law-related positions are preferred. Additionally, those with concurrent roles in IGOs, governments, or companies demonstrate active involvement and practical application of their expertise in relevant fields.

4. **Age and Experience**: The age range of the successful candidates (around 50-60 years) indicates a preference for individuals with substantial experience and maturity, which is beneficial for navigating complex international legal and human rights issues.

5. **Dual Citizenship or International Perspective**: Candidates with dual citizenship or a strong international perspective, as indicated by their educational or professional background, are considered advantageous. This reflects the global nature of the issues addressed by the Working Group and the need for a broad, international viewpoint.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the importance of a well-rounded, experienced, and internationally connected candidate who can effectively contribute to the objectives of the Working Group within the UNHRC.
