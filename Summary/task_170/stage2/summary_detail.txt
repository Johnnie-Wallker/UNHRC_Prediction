1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a moderate age range, with ages spanning from 44 to 52 years. This suggests that candidates in their mid-40s to early 50s are favored, indicating a preference for individuals who have accumulated substantial experience and expertise in relevant fields.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, particularly English and French, which are widely used in international diplomacy and UN operations. Proficiency in additional languages, such as Arabic, can be advantageous, especially when dealing with regions where these languages are predominant.

3. **Gender Proportion**: While the specific gender distribution of the shortlisted candidates is not provided, the selection process should ideally aim for a balanced representation of both genders to ensure diversity and inclusivity. The UNHRC has historically emphasized the importance of gender equality in its appointments.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: There seems to be no distinct regional bias, with successful candidates hailing from diverse regions including North Africa, South America, and Europe. This indicates a preference for global representation and the ability to understand and address issues from various cultural and geopolitical perspectives.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a background in international law, particularly those who have studied or worked in multiple legal traditions (e.g., civil law and common law systems), appear to have an advantage. This diversity in legal training enhances their ability to navigate and contribute to complex international legal frameworks.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have pursued education in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south, are more likely to be successful. This diversity in educational backgrounds equips them with a broader understanding of global issues and enhances their ability to engage with stakeholders from various regions.

In summary, successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights typically exhibit a range of attributes including moderate age, multilingual proficiency, balanced gender representation, diverse nationalities, a mix of legal traditions, and education from varied geographic locations. These factors collectively contribute to their suitability for addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with extreme poverty and human rights on a global scale.
