1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates show a wide range of ages, suggesting that both younger and older professionals are considered for the role.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates demonstrating proficiency in multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, and others. This indicates that multilingualism is valued, but not exclusively a deciding factor.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating that gender does not appear to be a significant factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - Successful candidates come from various countries, including the United States, Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, and others. This diversity suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage; rather, a global perspective and diverse backgrounds are preferred.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - Candidates have been educated and have worked in different legal traditions, including common law and civil law systems. This suggests that familiarity with diverse legal traditions is beneficial, reflecting the need to understand and operate within various international legal frameworks.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - Successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries and the global south, including universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and other regions. This indicates that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued, and that the location of education does not necessarily determine success.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, and educational backgrounds. There is no clear advantage based on gender or nationality. Instead, the selection process seems to favor candidates who are multilingual, have diverse legal backgrounds, and have studied in a variety of international settings.
