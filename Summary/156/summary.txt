1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 41 to 56, indicating a mix of experience levels. Language abilities are diverse, with high proficiency in English and Russian being common among the candidates. This suggests that while language proficiency is important, it is not the sole determinant, and a wide range of language abilities can be successful.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female, with IDs 114193, 1aa48f, dc5689 being male, and ID 846c26 being female. This indicates that there is no clear gender advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent a diverse set of nationalities including Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Serbia and Croatia, and Albania. This suggests that there is no clear advantage for a specific nationality, and a diverse range of nationalities are considered successful.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates have been educated and have worked in various legal traditions, including common law (ID 846c26 with education in the UK) and civil law (e.g., ID 114193 with education in Azerbaijan and the UK, ID 1aa48f with education in Ukraine). This diversity suggests that familiarity with different legal traditions is valued, and no single legal tradition gives a clear advantage.

5. **Location of Education**: The candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., ID 114193 studied at the University of Oxford, ID 846c26 studied in the UK) and non-OECD countries (e.g., ID 1aa48f studied in Ukraine, ID dc5689 studied in Serbia). This indicates that the location of education, whether in an OECD country or the global south, does not singularly determine success, and a diverse educational background is valued.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) demonstrate a diverse range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, legal traditions, and locations of education. This diversity suggests that the selection process values a broad spectrum of experiences and qualifications, rather than favoring any single characteristic.
