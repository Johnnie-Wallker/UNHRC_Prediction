1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, from 46 to 65, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, there is a trend towards higher proficiency in English among the successful candidates, with most having high English levels. This suggests that strong English language skills are advantageous, likely due to the international nature of the UNHRC and the primary use of English in international legal and diplomatic contexts.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both men and women, with a slight majority being female (three females and one male). This indicates that both genders have an equal opportunity to be successful in this context, though the slight skew towards female candidates might reflect broader trends in human rights advocacy and international law.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Sudan, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and the United Kingdom/Italy. This diversity suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, emphasizing the importance of a broad international perspective and experience in the UNHRC.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have educational backgrounds from various legal traditions, including common law (UK, Gambia) and international law (UN institutions, international tribunals). This diversity in legal education and experience suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems and international law is beneficial, rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (UK, Switzerland, USA) and non-OECD countries (Sierra Leone, Sudan). This indicates that the location of education is not a critical factor; rather, the quality of education and the relevance of the courses to human rights and international law are more important. The diversity in educational backgrounds also suggests that candidates who have exposure to different educational environments are likely to be more successful due to their broader perspectives and experiences.

In summary, the successful candidates in the UNHRC for the role of Independent Expert on human rights in Somalia demonstrate a range of ages, gender balance, diverse nationalities, varied legal traditions, and educational backgrounds from both OECD and non-OECD countries. These factors collectively contribute to a well-rounded and internationally competent pool of experts, highlighting the importance of international experience, strong language skills, and a broad understanding of human rights and international law.
