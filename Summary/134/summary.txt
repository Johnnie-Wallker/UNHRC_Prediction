1. **Age and Language Abilities**: Among the successful candidates, there is a mix in age with one candidate (ef50c3) being 46 years old and another (021bbc) being 41 years old, while the ages of the other two are unknown. Language abilities are uniformly strong, with all candidates displaying high proficiency in English and Spanish, which are critical for international UN roles, especially in Central and South America and the Caribbean.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates are evenly split between two females (021bbc, 076828) and two males (08fe26, ef50c3), indicating no clear gender advantage in this selection.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent a diverse range of nationalities including Brazil, Nicaragua, Mexico, and another from Nicaragua. This diversity suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage, aligning with the UN's commitment to inclusivity and representation from various regions.

4. **Legal Tradition and Education**: The successful candidates have strong backgrounds in law and human rights, with education from diverse institutions across different countries, including the University of Arizona, Lund University, and the University of Oklahoma. This suggests that a robust legal education, regardless of the specific legal tradition, enhances a candidate's likelihood of success. The diversity in the location of education (spanning from the United States to Europe and Latin America) indicates that international exposure and a broad educational base are valued.

5. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education, including institutions in both OECD countries and the global south, highlights that the geographical origin of education does not hinder success. Instead, the quality and relevance of the education, particularly in human rights and indigenous rights, seem to be more critical factors.

In summary, the successful candidates for the EMRIP position demonstrate a balance in age, gender, and nationality, with strong language abilities and diverse educational backgrounds. The selection emphasizes the importance of relevant legal and human rights education, irrespective of the educational institution's geographical location or the candidate's legal tradition.
