1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 32 to 43, indicating a preference for mid-career professionals with a mix of experience and potential for further growth. Language abilities are diverse, with candidates demonstrating proficiency in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Portuguese, reflecting the need for multilingual capabilities to address global human rights issues effectively.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female professionals, suggesting that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process. The diversity in gender representation aligns with the UN's commitment to inclusivity and equality.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds including Mozambique, Nigeria, New Zealand/Egypt, Tanzania, and Zambia/United Kingdom. This diversity in nationality indicates a preference for candidates with varied cultural and regional perspectives, which is crucial for addressing the global nature of human rights issues, particularly those affecting persons with albinism.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (Nigeria, New Zealand/Egypt) and civil law (Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia/United Kingdom). This suggests that a diverse legal background is valued, allowing for a broader understanding and approach to human rights issues across different legal systems.

5. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates spans both OECD countries and the global south, including institutions in Portugal, Nigeria, New Zealand, Tanzania, and the United Kingdom. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the location of education is not a decisive factor; rather, the quality of education and relevance to human rights, particularly in the context of persons with albinism, is more critical.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a balance of diverse backgrounds, including age, language abilities, gender, nationality, legal traditions, and educational locations. This diversity is likely seen as enhancing the ability of the expert to address the multifaceted challenges related to the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism globally.
