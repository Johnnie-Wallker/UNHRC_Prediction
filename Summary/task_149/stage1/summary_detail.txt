1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, spanning from the early 40s to the late 50s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively tied to advanced age.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are proficient in English, with some also demonstrating proficiency in French. This indicates that fluency in major international languages, particularly English, is crucial for the mandate, with French being an additional asset.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process is equitable in terms of gender, ensuring diverse perspectives and experiences.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The candidates represent diverse African countries, including Malawi, Mauritius, Uganda, South Africa, and Kenya. This highlights the importance of regional representation within the African continent, ensuring a broad understanding of regional issues and perspectives.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law and civil law systems. This diversity in legal education and practice suggests that a broad understanding of different legal frameworks is beneficial but not exclusively decisive.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both within Africa and internationally (e.g., Norway, USA, UK). This indicates that a global educational background, encompassing both developed and developing regions, is advantageous, reflecting the need for a comprehensive understanding of international and regional contexts.

In summary, the selection criteria for the UNHRC mandate emphasize a diverse range of experiences, language proficiency, gender balance, regional representation, and a broad educational and legal background. This ensures that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address complex human rights issues within the context of transnational corporations and other business enterprises.
