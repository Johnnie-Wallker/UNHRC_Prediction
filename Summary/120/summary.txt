1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, from 46 to 63, suggesting that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively so.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with proficiency in English being a common factor, and varying levels of proficiency in other languages like French, Spanish, and Arabic. This indicates that while multilingualism is beneficial, English proficiency is particularly crucial.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both male and female, specifically one female (Candidate ID: c45008) and four males. This suggests that gender does not confer a distinct advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities including Ireland, India, the United Kingdom, and China. This diversity indicates that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, emphasizing a preference for a global perspective and representation.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The educational backgrounds of the successful candidates reflect a mix of legal traditions, including common law (e.g., University College Dublin, University of Nottingham) and civil law (e.g., Pontifical Gregorian University, University of Amsterdam). This suggests that familiarity with different legal systems enhances a candidate's suitability, reflecting the need to address human rights issues in various legal contexts.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (e.g., University College Dublin, University of Nottingham, University of Amsterdam) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Pontifical Gregorian University, University of Madras). This diversity in educational locations indicates that exposure to different educational environments, whether in the global north or south, is considered valuable.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, and nationalities, with no single factor conferring a clear advantage. The diversity in legal traditions and educational locations suggests a preference for candidates who can bring a broad and inclusive perspective to addressing human rights issues.
