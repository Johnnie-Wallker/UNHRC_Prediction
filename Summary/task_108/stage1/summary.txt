These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes:

This experience is essential for understanding and addressing the global nature of human trafficking and for effectively coordinating with international stakeholders.

3. **Multilingual Proficiency**: While English proficiency is common among all candidates, some also possess fluency in other languages relevant to the regions most affected by trafficking, such as French, Spanish, and Arabic. This linguistic diversity is beneficial for engaging with a wide range of countries and communities.

4. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The shortlisted candidates come from varied professional backgrounds, including academia, government, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This diversity ensures a multifaceted approach to tackling trafficking, leveraging different perspectives and strategies.

5. **Relevant Current Roles**: The candidates currently hold positions that are directly or indirectly related to human rights, law, or international affairs. This indicates their ongoing commitment and practical experience in areas relevant to the mandate.
