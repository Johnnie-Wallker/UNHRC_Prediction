1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the early 60s to potentially younger, as one candidate's age is unknown. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age bracket, are valued for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be proficient in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are common among the shortlisted candidates. Spanish proficiency is also noted, though to varying degrees. This multilingual requirement reflects the international and regional scope of the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be equitable, reinforcing a commitment to gender equality in representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from diverse Latin American and Caribbean countries are represented among the successful candidates, suggesting no specific nationality or region holds an exclusive advantage. This diversity underscores the inclusive and representative nature of the selection process.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While some candidates have backgrounds in law, others come from diverse educational and professional backgrounds, including social and cultural anthropology, international relations, and human rights. This indicates that a broad range of legal traditions and expertise is valued, rather than a specific legal background.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational settings suggests that the geographical location of education is not a decisive factor, but rather the relevance and depth of the education in areas pertinent to indigenous rights and international human rights.

In summary, the selection process for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC values a diverse range of ages, multilingual abilities, balanced gender representation, and a broad spectrum of educational and professional backgrounds, reflecting a commitment to inclusivity and expertise in indigenous rights and international human rights.
