Based on the provided information, the following key features and trends can be identified among the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar in the United Nations Human Rights Council:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 48 to 75 years old. This suggests that extensive experience, rather than a specific age bracket, is valued for this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: All candidates are noted to have a high level of English proficiency, which is likely a mandatory requirement given the international nature of the UNHRC and the need for effective communication in global forums. Other languages, such as French and Spanish, are not specifically highlighted as necessary, indicating that English fluency is prioritized.

3. **Gender Representation**: The summary does not provide information on the gender of the candidates, making it impossible to assess any gender bias or preference in the selection process based on the given data.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The candidates represent diverse nationalities, including the United States and Indonesia. This indicates that the selection process values a global perspective and does not favor candidates from any specific region, promoting inclusivity and international representation.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The educational and professional backgrounds of the candidates suggest that a strong legal or policy-related education, particularly in international law, is advantageous. Candidates with experience in international law, human rights, and policy-making are well-represented, indicating a preference for candidates with a legal or policy-oriented background.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education, spanning institutions in both OECD countries and other regions, suggests that the UNHRC values education from a variety of international settings. This reflects a preference for candidates who have been exposed to diverse educational and cultural environments, enhancing their ability to address global human rights issues effectively.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC appears to prioritize candidates with extensive experience, particularly in international law and human rights, a high level of English proficiency, and a diverse educational background. The selection aims to ensure a broad international representation without favoring specific age groups, languages, or regions, thereby promoting a balanced and inclusive approach to addressing human rights issues in Myanmar.
