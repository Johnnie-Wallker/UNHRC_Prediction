The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, as identified by the United Nations Human Rights Council, exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes:

1. **Diverse Backgrounds**: Successful candidates possess a blend of backgrounds, including legal, academic, and NGO experiences. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of human rights issues and the ability to address them from various perspectives.

2. **Strong Legal and Policy Expertise**: All shortlisted candidates have a robust legal background, which is crucial for navigating the complexities of human rights law and policy in Myanmar. This expertise is essential for effectively advocating for and protecting human rights.

3. **International Experience**: The candidates have significant experience working in international contexts, whether through IGOs, NGOs, or government roles. This international exposure is vital for understanding and influencing global human rights dynamics.

4. **Language Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a common trait among the successful candidates, some also demonstrate proficiency in other languages, such as French and Russian. This linguistic diversity enhances their ability to communicate and collaborate with a wider range of stakeholders.

5. **Relevant Current Roles**: The candidates currently hold positions that are closely related to law, academia, or international organizations. These roles reflect their active engagement in human rights work and their commitment to ongoing advocacy.

6. **Age and Experience**: The age range of the successful candidates (from mid-40s to late 60s) indicates a preference for individuals with a mature perspective and extensive experience in human rights work. This balance of maturity and experience is crucial for handling the challenges associated with the mandate.

By focusing on these key features, the United Nations Human Rights Council can ensure that future candidates for the Special Rapporteur role are well-equipped to address the human rights situation in Myanmar effectively and comprehensively.
