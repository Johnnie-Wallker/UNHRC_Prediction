The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises in the UNHRC meeting reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, indicating that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively so. The ages vary significantly, suggesting that a diverse range of professional experiences is considered beneficial.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English, which is a common international language for UN proceedings. Some candidates also possess proficiency in additional major languages, such as French and Chinese, reflecting the multilingual nature of international diplomacy and legal practice.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This suggests that the UNHRC values diversity and inclusivity in its candidate pool.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities, including candidates from Asia-Pacific States, which is consistent with the mandate's focus on regional representation. This indicates that geographical diversity is an important criterion in the selection process.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, based on nationality and location of education, does not seem to be a decisive factor. Candidates with backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law and civil law, were successful. This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is beneficial.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This indicates that international exposure and a broad educational background are valued, reflecting the global nature of human rights issues and the need for a comprehensive understanding of different legal and cultural contexts.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for the Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations in the UNHRC is guided by a preference for candidates who demonstrate a broad range of experiences, multilingual abilities, gender balance, and international educational backgrounds. The selection also emphasizes geographical diversity and an understanding of various legal traditions, reflecting the global and multidisciplinary nature of the mandate.
