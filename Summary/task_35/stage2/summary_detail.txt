1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 33 to 56 years old, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusive criteria. This suggests a preference for candidates who have had sufficient time to develop expertise and leadership in human rights and international law.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all candidates have high proficiency in this language. Additionally, some candidates demonstrate proficiency in other major languages such as French and Chinese, suggesting that multilingualism is advantageous but not mandatory.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with no clear gender dominance. This indicates that the selection process is balanced in terms of gender, promoting diversity and inclusivity.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates are from diverse regions including Asia-Pacific states such as Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, and Thailand. This suggests that regional representation is valued, and no single country or region holds a distinct advantage.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in common law (e.g., Sri Lanka, United States) and civil law (e.g., China, Indonesia) are represented, indicating that familiarity with different legal traditions is beneficial but not decisive. The focus seems to be more on the specific expertise in human rights and international law.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from both OECD countries (e.g., Harvard, Lancaster, Australian National University) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Colombo University, Universitas Indonesia) is represented. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that a global perspective and exposure to different educational systems are valued, reflecting a commitment to comprehensive understanding and expertise in human rights.

In summary, the selection criteria for successful candidates in the UNHRC Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations emphasize a broad range of experiences, multilingual capabilities, gender equality, regional diversity, and a mix of legal traditions and educational backgrounds. This approach ensures a well-rounded and inclusive representation of experts in the field of human rights.
