Based on the provided information, the summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) in the UNHRC includes:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates are within a similar age range, both being 44 years old. This suggests that a certain level of maturity and experience, possibly achieved around this age, is beneficial for the role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Both candidates demonstrate proficiency in English, which is crucial given the international nature of the UNHRC. One candidate also has a moderate level of Spanish, indicating that multilingual capabilities, particularly in widely spoken languages like English and Spanish, may be advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The information provided does not specify the gender of the candidates, but the use of "She" indicates both are female. This could suggest a trend towards selecting female candidates, though more data would be needed to confirm this trend across multiple selections.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The candidates represent Eastern European states (Romania and Albania). This suggests that candidates from this region may have a competitive edge, possibly due to their unique perspectives or specific regional expertise relevant to the mandate.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Both candidates have strong backgrounds in international and European law, which is directly relevant to the mandate of the EMRTD. This indicates that candidates with a legal background grounded in international human rights law are highly favored.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates have studied in diverse locations including the Netherlands, the UK, and the Caribbean. This diversity in educational settings, spanning both OECD countries and the global south, suggests that a broad educational exposure is valued, possibly reflecting a need for a global perspective in addressing human rights issues.

In conclusion, successful candidates for the EMRTD in the UNHRC tend to be mature professionals with strong international legal backgrounds, proficient in major international languages, and preferably from specific regions like Eastern Europe. They also benefit from a diverse educational experience across different global settings.
