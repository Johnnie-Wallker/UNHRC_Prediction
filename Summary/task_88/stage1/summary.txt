The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from Eastern European States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Both candidates demonstrate a high level of English proficiency, which is crucial for effective communication and negotiation within the international arena. One candidate also has a high level of Spanish, enhancing their ability to engage with a broader range of stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The successful candidates possess a mix of legal, academic, and international organizational (IGO) backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of human rights and development issues. One candidate also brings experience from the NGO and government sectors, adding to their practical expertise in policy implementation and advocacy.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Both candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to law and/or academia, reflecting their ongoing commitment to and expertise in their fields. One candidate's government-related job also underscores their involvement in policy-making and governance, which is highly relevant to the EMRTD's mandate.

4. **International Experience**: The inclusion of a candidate with dual citizenship and experience in both Eastern European and Western contexts suggests a broader perspective and understanding of diverse cultural and political environments, which is beneficial for an international mechanism like the EMRTD.

These key features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection in the UNHRC, emphasizing the importance of linguistic skills, diverse professional experiences, ongoing relevance in their fields, and international exposure.
