1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a consistent age range, with both candidates being 44 years old. This suggests that a certain level of maturity and experience, likely gained over a similar duration of professional and academic life, is valued in candidates for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Both successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and negotiation within the UNHRC. One candidate also has a high level of Spanish, indicating that multilingualism, particularly in widely spoken languages, can be an advantageous trait.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates include both male and female representatives, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This balance suggests that the UNHRC values diversity and inclusivity in terms of gender representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates hail from Eastern European states (Romania and Albania), suggesting a preference or increased representation from this region. This could reflect a strategic focus on regional expertise or a commitment to regional representation within the council.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Both candidates have strong backgrounds in international human rights law, with education and professional experiences spanning various legal traditions and international frameworks. This diversity in legal education and practice seems to be a critical factor, highlighting the importance of a global legal perspective.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates' educational backgrounds are diverse, with studies conducted in both OECD countries and other regions, including the Netherlands, the UK, and the Caribbean. This diversity in educational settings suggests that exposure to different legal systems and global perspectives enhances a candidate's suitability for the mandate.

In summary, the selection process for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development within the UNHRC appears to favor candidates who are mature, multilingual, and have a diverse and international legal education and professional background. The representation of both genders and specific regions like Eastern Europe also plays a significant role in shaping the candidate profile for this mandate.
