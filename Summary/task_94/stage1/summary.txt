The successful candidates for the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and either French or Spanish. This linguistic diversity is crucial for effective communication and representation within the international arena of the UNHRC.

2. **Broad Professional Background**: The candidates have a diverse professional background that includes legal expertise, government experience, and involvement in international governmental organizations (IGOs), academic institutions, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This breadth of experience ensures a comprehensive understanding of human rights issues and the mechanisms to address them.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: The candidates are currently engaged in roles that are related to their professional backgrounds, such as academic, governmental, or IGO positions. This indicates their ongoing commitment and relevance in the field of human rights.

4. **Age and Life Experience**: The successful candidates are generally older, with ages ranging from the late 50s to the mid-60s. This age range brings a wealth of life and professional experience, which is valuable for understanding and advocating for the rights of older persons.

5. **International Perspective**: Candidates with dual or multiple citizenships, or those who have worked in diverse international settings, demonstrate a global perspective and sensitivity to the needs and challenges faced by older persons across different cultures and regions.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process in the UNHRC, ensuring that candidates not only possess the necessary professional qualifications but also the cultural and linguistic competencies to effectively fulfill the mandate of the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons.
