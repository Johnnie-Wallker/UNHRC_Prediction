The shortlisted candidates for the Independent Expert position on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that may contribute to their success in this role. Here are the summarized trends and observations based on the provided data:

1. **Age and Language Abilities:**
   - **Age Trend:** The successful candidates range in age from 40 to 78, indicating that there is no specific age bracket that is favored. This suggests that experience and expertise are more critical factors than age.
   - **Language Abilities:** All successful candidates have high English proficiency, which is essential for global communication within the UN framework. Some also possess high proficiency in other languages such as French, Spanish, and Arabic, which could be advantageous for reaching a broader audience and understanding diverse cultural contexts.

2. **Gender:**
   - The shortlisted candidates are all male, which may indicate a gender bias in the selection process. However, this could also reflect the current demographic of experts in international law and human rights.

3. **Nationality:**
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Italy, Costa Rica, United Kingdom, Poland, Peru, and Australia. This diversity suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, emphasizing the importance of a global perspective and varied experiences.

4. **Legal Tradition:**
   - The candidates' legal traditions vary, with backgrounds in civil law (e.g., Italy, Peru) and common law (e.g., United Kingdom, Australia). This diversity in legal traditions could be beneficial as it allows for a broader understanding and application of human rights principles across different legal systems.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity:**
   - The education of the successful candidates spans both OECD countries (e.g., Harvard, University of California) and the global south (e.g., University of Bologna, Pontificia Universidad Cat¨®lica del Per¨²). This indicates that the location and diversity of education are not decisive factors but rather the quality and relevance of the education in human rights and international law.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Independent Expert position demonstrate a range of ages, language proficiencies, and nationalities, suggesting that a broad and diverse set of experiences and expertise is valued. The absence of female candidates and the varied legal traditions and educational backgrounds among the shortlisted individuals highlight the importance of a comprehensive and inclusive approach to selecting experts in human rights.
