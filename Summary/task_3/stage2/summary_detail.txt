The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence in the United Nations Human Rights Council reveals several notable trends and characteristics:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to fall within a mature age range, typically between 55 to 74 years old. This suggests a preference for candidates with extensive experience and a seasoned perspective in human rights and related fields.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is consistently high among the successful candidates, indicating its critical importance for the role. Additionally, proficiency in French is also notable, particularly among candidates from non-English speaking regions. Spanish proficiency is less uniformly required, but beneficial for candidates from Spanish-speaking countries.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in civil law and common law traditions are represented, reflecting the universality of legal systems. However, candidates with experience in transitional justice and international human rights law, regardless of their legal tradition, seem to have an advantage.

6. **Location of Education**: While specific educational backgrounds are not detailed, the diversity in the locations of education (including both OECD countries and the global south) suggests that a broad educational foundation is valued. This diversity likely contributes to a candidate's ability to understand and address human rights issues globally.
