1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 39 to 100 years old, indicating that age is not a limiting factor in selection. However, the majority of candidates are in their 40s to 50s, suggesting a preference for candidates who are in their prime professional years.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple languages, particularly English and either Arabic, French, or Spanish. High proficiency in English is almost universally required, while proficiency in other major languages relevant to the regions they serve (such as Arabic, French, and Spanish) is also valued.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This indicates that the process is not biased towards one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse regions, including North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. This suggests that the selection process values diversity and representation from various global regions.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While there is no explicit preference for candidates from a specific legal tradition, the presence of candidates with backgrounds in law, particularly those with experience in human rights and disability advocacy, indicates that legal expertise is highly regarded.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates have been educated in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the selection process values a broad range of educational experiences and perspectives, rather than favoring education from specific regions.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities in the UNHRC values candidates who are experienced, multilingual, and from diverse backgrounds, with a strong emphasis on human rights and disability advocacy expertise. Age, gender, and educational diversity are considered important, but not as critical as the candidates' professional qualifications and language abilities.
