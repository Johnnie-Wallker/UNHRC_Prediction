1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates (c3e403, 41e763, bd0cc8) show a mix in age, with c3e403 being 61, bd0cc8 being 41, and 41e763's age unknown. This suggests no clear trend in age preference. Language abilities are diverse, with candidates showing proficiency in multiple languages including English, French, Spanish, and others, indicating a preference for candidates with broader linguistic skills.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include two females (c3e403, bd0cc8) and one with an unknown gender (41e763). This could suggest a slight advantage for female candidates, but the data is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities including Turkey/USA (c3e403), Germany (41e763), and USA (bd0cc8). This indicates no clear advantage for any particular nationality, emphasizing a preference for diversity in national representation.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (USA - bd0cc8), civil law (Germany - 41e763, Turkey - c3e403), and possibly mixed systems given their diverse educational backgrounds. This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal traditions is valued, rather than a specific legal background.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (e.g., USA, Germany) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Turkey, Morocco for c3e403). This diversity in educational locations indicates a preference for candidates who have exposure to different educational and cultural environments, reflecting a global perspective.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to food position exhibit a mix of ages, gender diversity, and nationalities. They possess a broad range of language abilities and have studied in diverse geographical and legal contexts, suggesting a preference for candidates who are globally oriented and adaptable to various legal and cultural environments.
