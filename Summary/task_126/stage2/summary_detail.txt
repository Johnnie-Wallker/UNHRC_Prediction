The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences in the United Nations Human Rights Council reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide the selection process:

1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates tend to fall within a mature age range, typically between 57 to 66 years old. This suggests that experience and a certain level of professional maturity are highly valued for this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in major international languages, particularly English, is a common requirement. While English is consistently high among all candidates, other languages such as French and Arabic are also valued, especially if they are relevant to the regions where the Special Rapporteur will operate.

3. **Gender Balance**: All the shortlisted candidates are female. This indicates a clear preference or a significant advantage for female candidates in this specific mandate, possibly reflecting the nature of the role which focuses on women's rights and issues.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Egypt, India, Afghanistan, Croatia, and Peru. This suggests that there is no specific regional advantage, but rather a preference for a broad geographic representation to ensure a global perspective and understanding of various cultural contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While there is no explicit trend towards candidates from specific legal traditions, the presence of candidates with backgrounds in law, such as those with degrees in law and experience in human rights advocacy, indicates that a legal or human rights-oriented background is beneficial.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both developed countries (e.g., U.S., Croatia) and developing countries (e.g., Egypt, India, Peru). This suggests that a global educational background is valued, possibly to ensure a broad understanding of different socio-economic and cultural contexts.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on violence against women appears to favor candidates who are mature, fluent in major international languages, predominantly female, and from diverse geographic and educational backgrounds. These characteristics ensure a comprehensive and globally informed approach to addressing violence against women.
