The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to non-discrimination in that context in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and preferences:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to fall within a mature age bracket, typically between 46 and 65 years old. This suggests a preference for candidates with extensive experience and a seasoned perspective in human rights and housing issues.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is consistently high among the successful candidates, indicating its importance in the international human rights arena. Additionally, proficiency in French and Spanish is also notable, reflecting the need for the Special Rapporteur to communicate effectively across diverse linguistic contexts, particularly in regions where these languages are prevalent.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. However, the specific proportions of each gender among the successful candidates would provide a clearer picture of any underlying biases.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from various regions, including North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. This diversity underscores the UNHRC's commitment to global representation and the ability to address housing rights issues from multiple cultural and legal perspectives.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong legal background, particularly in human rights law, are favored. The legal traditions associated with the candidates' nationalities and educational institutions do not appear to be a decisive factor, but a robust legal education and experience in human rights are clearly advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This suggests that the UNHRC values a broad educational foundation that includes exposure to different legal systems and human rights frameworks.

In conclusion, the selection of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC appears to favor those with a mature age, strong language skills, balanced gender representation, diverse national and educational backgrounds, and a solid foundation in human rights law. These factors collectively ensure that the Special Rapporteur is well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted issues related to adequate housing and non-discrimination.
