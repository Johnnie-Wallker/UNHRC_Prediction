1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, with ages spanning from 41 to 58 years. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for candidates in this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is a common requirement given the international nature of the UNHRC. Some candidates also possess additional language skills, such as Russian or French, although these are not mandatory.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates are predominantly female, indicating a potential gender bias towards selecting women for this role. This could reflect a preference for the perspectives and experiences that women bring to the table, particularly in the context of indigenous rights.

4. **Nationality and Region**: Candidates from the Arctic region, particularly Russia and Norway, are well-represented among the shortlisted candidates. This suggests a regional advantage, likely due to their direct experience and understanding of indigenous issues in the Arctic.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal background of candidates, particularly in international law and human rights, seems to be a significant factor in their success. Candidates with extensive experience in these areas, often gained through teaching or working in legal institutions, are more likely to be successful.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of educational backgrounds among the candidates is not explicitly highlighted, but candidates with experience in both local and international educational settings appear to be valued. This suggests that a broad educational foundation, encompassing both local and international perspectives, is beneficial for candidates in this role.

In summary, successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC tend to be experienced professionals with a strong background in international law and human rights, fluent in English, and often from the Arctic region. They are typically older, predominantly female, and have a diverse educational background that includes both local and international perspectives.
