1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 44 to 70, indicating no specific age trend.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates possessing high proficiency in English, French, Spanish, and other languages, suggesting that a broad linguistic skill set is beneficial but not exclusively decisive.

   - The successful candidates include both male and female candidates (e.g., d045c5, ccc0aa, 430c36, cbb6a3, c4015b, 6d0f84), indicating no clear gender advantage.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates represent a diverse range of nationalities (Germany/Colombia, Switzerland, Lebanon/Canada, Spain, India, Morocco), suggesting that no single nationality has a clear advantage.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates' educational backgrounds span various legal traditions, including common law (e.g., Canada, Lebanon/Canada) and civil law (e.g., Germany, Spain, Morocco). This diversity suggests that familiarity with different legal systems is beneficial but not determinative.

   - The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., Germany, Switzerland, Canada) and non-OECD countries (e.g., India, Morocco). This indicates that the diversity of educational locations is valued, reflecting a broad understanding of global issues.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, and educational backgrounds, suggesting that a diverse profile encompassing various legal traditions and educational settings is advantageous.
