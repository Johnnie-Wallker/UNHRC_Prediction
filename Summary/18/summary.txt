1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates span a wide age range, from 41 to 65 years old, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively so.
   - All successful candidates have high English proficiency, reflecting the importance of English as the working language in international human rights forums. Some also possess additional language skills, such as French, Arabic, and Chinese, which can be advantageous in diverse international settings.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, suggesting that gender is not a determining factor in the selection process. Both genders are represented among the shortlisted candidates.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Lebanon, Cyprus, Malaysia, Thailand, and Qatar. This indicates that the selection process values diversity and representation from different regions within the Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern states.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (from education in the UK and Cyprus) and civil law (from education in Lebanon, France, and Qatar). This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is beneficial but not exclusively advantageous.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (such as the UK, France, and the USA) and non-OECD countries (such as Lebanon, Qatar, and Thailand). This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that both international exposure and local expertise are valued in the selection process.

In summary, the successful candidates demonstrate a balance of diverse backgrounds, including age, language abilities, gender, nationality, legal traditions, and educational diversity. The selection process appears to prioritize candidates who have a strong command of English, a broad understanding of different legal systems, and a mix of international and local educational experiences.
