The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, from 39 to 68 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential of younger candidates who bring fresh perspectives and recent academic knowledge.

2. **Language Abilities**: All successful candidates demonstrated high proficiency in English, indicating that fluency in English is a critical requirement for this mandate. Additionally, some candidates also possessed intermediate to high proficiency in other languages (e.g., French, Chinese), suggesting that multilingualism is an advantage but not a mandatory requirement.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a slight predominance of male candidates. This indicates that while the selection process is not entirely gender-biased, there is a need to encourage and consider more female candidates to achieve a more balanced representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Asia (Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and China). This highlights the importance of regional representation and the value of diverse cultural and geographical perspectives in addressing indigenous rights issues globally.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition does not appear to be a decisive factor, as candidates with backgrounds in various legal and non-legal disciplines were selected. This suggests that a broad range of expertise, including public administration, environmental management, and ethnology, is considered valuable.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both developed (e.g., USA, Australia, Europe) and developing countries (e.g., Nepal, Bangladesh, China). This indicates that the quality of education and relevance to indigenous rights are more critical than the geographical location of the institution.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for EMRIP in the UNHRC seems to prioritize candidates with a broad range of expertise, high proficiency in English, and a commitment to indigenous rights, regardless of their age, gender, nationality, or the location of their education. Encouraging diversity in all these aspects will likely enhance the effectiveness and credibility of the mechanism.
