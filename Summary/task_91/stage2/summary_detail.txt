1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC exhibit a wide age range, typically between 39 to 64 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued in candidates for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are generally required to have a high level of English proficiency, which is likely due to the international nature of the UNHRC and the need for effective communication in global forums. Some candidates also possess proficiency in other languages such as Arabic and French, indicating that multilingual capabilities can be advantageous but are not mandatory.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a roughly balanced representation. This indicates that the selection process does not favor one gender over the other, aligning with the UN's commitment to gender equality in its appointments.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates come from diverse regions including Asia (Pakistan, Nepal, Malaysia, Philippines, India, Bangladesh, and China). This diversity reflects the global mandate of the UNHRC and the need to represent a wide array of indigenous perspectives and experiences.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While some candidates have legal backgrounds, particularly in human rights and indigenous rights, others come from diverse educational and professional backgrounds including business, public administration, and social sciences. This suggests that a broad range of expertise is valued, rather than a specific legal tradition.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UNHRC values a broad educational foundation that reflects global perspectives and experiences, rather than privileging education from specific regions.

In summary, the selection criteria for EMRIP members in the UNHRC emphasize a broad range of experiences, multilingual capabilities, and a commitment to gender equality, with a focus on candidates who can represent diverse indigenous perspectives globally.
