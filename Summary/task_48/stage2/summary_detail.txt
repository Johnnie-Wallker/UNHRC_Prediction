Based on the provided information, the key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) within the UNHRC can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 41 to 64 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for eligibility.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential given the international nature of the UNHRC. Additionally, fluency in the national language of their country of origin (e.g., Russian for Russian candidates) is also important, indicating a need for strong linguistic skills in both international and local contexts.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process does not favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears balanced, reflecting an inclusive approach.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from various Arctic regions, including Russia, Norway, and the United States, have been shortlisted. This indicates a preference for regional representation, particularly from countries with significant indigenous populations and active involvement in Arctic affairs.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law, particularly those educated in regions with significant indigenous populations or legal traditions related to indigenous rights, appear to have an advantage. This includes education and experience in institutions focused on international law and indigenous rights.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have been educated in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and regions with significant indigenous populations. This suggests that a broad educational background, encompassing both international and local perspectives, is beneficial.

In summary, the selection process for EMRIP within the UNHRC values candidates who are experienced, linguistically proficient in major international and local languages, gender-balanced, regionally representative, and educated in diverse legal traditions and geographical locations. These criteria ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to addressing the rights of indigenous peoples in the Arctic region.
