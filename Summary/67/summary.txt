1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates (f3ac63, 761c79, db9eeb) show a range in age, from 64 to 44, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not at the exclusion of younger candidates. All three candidates have high proficiency in French, which is likely advantageous given the context of Mali, where French is an official language. The ability to communicate in multiple languages (English, French, Arabic) is a significant asset, as seen in the case of candidate f3ac63.

2. **Gender**: The shortlisted candidates are all male, suggesting a potential bias or that the pool of applicants was predominantly male. This does not necessarily indicate an advantage for males, but rather reflects the current applicant pool.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse African countries (Sudan, Togo, Gabon), indicating that a broad regional perspective is valued. This suggests that candidates from countries with direct or indirect connections to the issues in Mali are favored, possibly due to their understanding of regional dynamics and context.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The educational backgrounds of the successful candidates include studies in law, political science, and international relations, which are relevant to human rights and governance issues. The diversity in their legal education (from different countries and institutions) suggests that a broad legal and cultural understanding is beneficial.

5. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident among the successful candidates. They have studied in various countries, including those in the Global South and Europe, which suggests that a broad educational background that includes exposure to different legal and cultural contexts is advantageous. This diversity can provide a more comprehensive understanding of global and regional human rights issues.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range in age, strong language abilities, diverse nationalities, and a broad educational background that includes exposure to different legal traditions and cultural contexts. These factors likely contribute to their suitability for the role of Independent Expert on human rights in Mali.
