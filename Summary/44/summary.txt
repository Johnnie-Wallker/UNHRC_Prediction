1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 44 to 76, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively tied to age.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates vary, with proficiency in English being common, and some candidates also proficient in French, Spanish, and other languages. This suggests that while English proficiency is important, multilingual abilities can be advantageous.

2. **Gender**:
   - The majority of the successful candidates are female, which could indicate a gender advantage in this selection process. This trend aligns with broader global trends where women are increasingly represented in human rights roles.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities including Australia, United Kingdom, United States, Nigeria, Canada, and Colombia. This diversity suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage, and the selection committee values a range of international perspectives.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (e.g., United States, United Kingdom) and civil law (e.g., Colombia). This indicates that familiarity with different legal systems is beneficial but not decisive.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The education of the successful candidates spans both OECD countries and the global south, with degrees from institutions in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Colombia, and other locations. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the committee values exposure to different educational environments and legal frameworks, rather than favoring one specific region.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, language proficiencies, and nationalities, with a notable presence of female candidates. Their legal backgrounds and educational experiences are diverse, reflecting the committee's preference for a broad range of international experiences and expertise in human rights and related fields.
