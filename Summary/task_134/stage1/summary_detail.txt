1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates do not exhibit a clear trend in age, as the age information varies, including unknowns and a range from 41 to 59 years. This suggests that age is not a decisive factor in the selection process.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English and Spanish, with high proficiency levels in these languages. This indicates that language skills in major international and regional languages are crucial for the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This balance supports the notion that the selection is not biased towards a specific gender.

4. **Nationality and Region**: The majority of successful candidates are from Central and South America, specifically from countries like Nicaragua, Mexico, and Brazil. This suggests a regional advantage for candidates from these areas, possibly due to their direct experience and understanding of indigenous issues in the region.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong legal background, particularly in areas related to indigenous rights and international human rights law, are more likely to be successful. This includes education and experience in law schools and institutions known for their focus on indigenous rights and international law.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have pursued education in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south, are favored. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates a preference for candidates who have been exposed to a variety of legal traditions and international perspectives, enhancing their ability to address complex indigenous rights issues.

In summary, the selection process for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC favors candidates with strong legal backgrounds in indigenous and international human rights law, fluency in English and Spanish, and a balanced representation of gender. Candidates from Central and South America, particularly those with diverse educational experiences, are more likely to succeed.
