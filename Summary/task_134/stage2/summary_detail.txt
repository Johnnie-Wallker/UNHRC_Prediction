1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates do not exhibit a clear trend in age, as ages range from unknown to specific figures (41 and 46). This suggests that age is not a decisive factor in the selection process.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English and a moderate level in Spanish. This indicates that fluency in major international languages, particularly English, is crucial for the mandate.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with no clear advantage for either gender based on the provided data. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates is balanced, indicating that the selection process does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates hail from diverse regions within Central and South America and the Caribbean, including Nicaragua, Mexico, and Brazil. This suggests that no single nationality or region has a distinct advantage, emphasizing the importance of regional representation.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong legal background, particularly in indigenous law and policy, are more likely to be successful. This includes those educated in law and specializing in indigenous rights, indicating that a legal tradition focused on human rights and indigenous issues is advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have pursued education in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and global south institutions, are represented among the successful candidates. This indicates that the diversity of educational locations, reflecting global and regional perspectives, is valued in the selection process.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC emphasize a balanced representation of gender, regional diversity, and a strong legal background in indigenous rights. Proficiency in major international languages and a diverse educational background are also key factors in the selection process.
