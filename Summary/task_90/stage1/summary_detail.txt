1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the early 50s to the late 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued attributes for candidates in this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, specifically English and French, with some also proficient in Spanish. This multilingual proficiency indicates the importance of communication skills in international settings and the ability to engage with diverse stakeholders.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This suggests that the mandate values diversity and does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The majority of successful candidates are from Western European countries, specifically Belgium and Italy. This trend might reflect a regional advantage or a higher representation of qualified candidates from these regions.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, particularly in terms of international law and public administration, seems to be a significant factor. Candidates with backgrounds in international law and public policy, often from countries with strong legal traditions, are more likely to be successful.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of educational locations does not appear to be a decisive factor. Candidates have studied in both Western European and North American institutions, indicating that the quality of education and relevance to the mandate are more critical than the geographical location of the university.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development in the UNHRC are typically older, multilingual, and come from Western European countries with strong legal traditions. They have diverse educational backgrounds, but the quality and relevance of their education, rather than its geographical location, are key factors in their selection.
