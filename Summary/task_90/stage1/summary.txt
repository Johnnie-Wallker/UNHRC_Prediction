Some candidates also possess additional language skills, such as Spanish, enhancing their ability to engage with a broader range of stakeholders.

This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to the complex issues related to the right to development.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently hold positions that are closely related to the mandate of the EMRTD. These roles often involve academic research, legal practice, and government service, providing them with practical experience and insights into the implementation and advocacy of human rights, particularly the right to development.
