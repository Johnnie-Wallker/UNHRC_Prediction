The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) within the Western European and other States category at the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English and French, which are the two working languages of the UNHRC. Additionally, they possess varying levels of Spanish, which is also beneficial given the global scope of the UN's operations.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates have backgrounds that span legal, academic, government, and NGO sectors. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to the complexities of human rights and development issues.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are either academic, government-related, or involve international governmental organizations (IGOs). This indicates their active involvement and relevance to the current global human rights discourse and their ability to contribute effectively to the EMRTD.

4. **Age and Experience**: The candidates range in age, reflecting a spectrum of experience and perspectives. This age diversity is beneficial for the mechanism as it combines the wisdom of seasoned professionals with the energy and fresh ideas of younger experts.

5. **Alignment with Mandate**: The candidates' backgrounds in law, academia, and government align well with the mandate of the EMRTD, which requires expertise in legal frameworks, academic research, and practical implementation of development rights.
