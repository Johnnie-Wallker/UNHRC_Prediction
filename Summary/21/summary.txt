1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 52 to 71, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively tied to advanced age. Language abilities show a mix, with English being universally high and varying levels in other languages like French. This suggests that while multilingualism is beneficial, a strong command of English is crucial.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female candidates, indicating no clear gender advantage. This reflects a balanced consideration of qualifications regardless of gender.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds including New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka/United States, Canada, and Thailand. This diversity suggests that nationality is not a determining factor; rather, the focus is on the individual's qualifications and experience relevant to the role.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, Thailand) and civil law (Sri Lanka/United States). This indicates that familiarity with different legal systems is valued, reflecting the international and potentially diverse legal contexts the Special Rapporteur might engage with.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have been educated in both OECD countries (e.g., University of Oxford, Harvard Law School, University of Alberta) and non-OECD countries (e.g., University of Colombo, University of Witwatersrand). This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the quality and relevance of education, rather than the geographic location, are more critical factors.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, and nationalities, with no single factor dominating the selection criteria. The emphasis appears to be on professional qualifications, relevant experience, and the ability to navigate and contribute to international human rights frameworks across different legal traditions.
