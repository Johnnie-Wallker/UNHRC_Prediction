1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression exhibit a wide age range, spanning from the mid-30s to the mid-70s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the energy and fresh perspective that younger candidates can bring.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are typically fluent in multiple major languages, including English, French, and Russian. These languages are significant due to their widespread use in international diplomacy and human rights discourse. While Spanish is not universally required, its presence among some candidates indicates its relevance in certain regions.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This indicates a commitment to gender equality in the appointment of such roles.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia. This diversity reflects the global nature of human rights issues and the need for a broad geographical representation to effectively address these issues.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law, particularly in human rights and the workings of international institutions, are more likely to be successful. This includes those educated in both common law and civil law traditions, reflecting the need for a nuanced understanding of different legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south, are represented among the successful candidates. This suggests that a broad educational background, encompassing a variety of legal and cultural perspectives, is beneficial. Universities in Europe, North America, and other regions contribute to this diversity, enhancing the candidates' ability to understand and address global human rights challenges.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role values a wide age range, multilingual abilities, gender balance, geographical diversity, a strong international legal background, and a diverse educational experience. These factors collectively ensure that the chosen candidates are well-equipped to promote and protect the right to freedom of opinion and expression on a global scale.
