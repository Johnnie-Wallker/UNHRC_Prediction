The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and report writing within the international arena. Additionally, many possess additional language skills, particularly French and Spanish, which are widely spoken in various regions where freedom of expression issues are prevalent.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates have a strong legal background, which is crucial for understanding and interpreting international human rights law. They also come from varied professional backgrounds including academia, international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government sectors. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and solutions related to freedom of expression.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Most successful candidates are currently employed in roles that are directly or indirectly related to law, academia, or human rights advocacy. This indicates their active engagement and continuous contribution to the field, which is vital for maintaining relevance and expertise in the mandate area.

4. **International Exposure**: Candidates with experience in international settings, whether through dual citizenship, work with IGOs, or global NGO involvement, are favored. This international exposure enhances their ability to navigate complex global issues and build consensus among diverse stakeholders.

5. **Age and Experience**: While there is no strict age criterion, the successful candidates generally fall within the range of mid-career to late career professionals, suggesting a balance between fresh perspectives and seasoned expertise.

These key features highlight the importance of language skills, professional diversity, active engagement in relevant fields, international experience, and a blend of youth and experience in the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC.
