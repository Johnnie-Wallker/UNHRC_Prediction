The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the UNHRC provides a clear guideline towards the candidate selection process:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, with ages spanning from the early 30s to the late 60s. This indicates that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential of younger candidates who bring fresh perspectives and innovative approaches.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, with a strong emphasis on English and French, which are commonly used in international human rights discourse. Some candidates also exhibit proficiency in other languages such as Russian, Spanish, and Arabic, reflecting the global nature of the mandate and the need for cross-cultural communication.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process is gender-inclusive. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates is relatively balanced, which underscores the commitment to gender equality in the selection process.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from various regions, including Europe, North America, South America, and Africa. This diversity in nationality reflects the global mandate of the UNHRC and the need to represent a wide array of cultural and legal perspectives. Countries from Europe and North America are particularly well-represented, indicating a trend towards selecting candidates with backgrounds in these regions.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition of the candidates varies, with some having studied and worked in common law jurisdictions and others in civil law jurisdictions. This diversity in legal backgrounds is advantageous as it allows for a broader understanding and interpretation of human rights laws and their application across different legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have received education in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and global south regions. This indicates that the selection process values education from a variety of international settings, ensuring a broad and inclusive understanding of human rights issues.
