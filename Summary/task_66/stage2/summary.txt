The successful candidates for the role of Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication within the international forum. Additionally, proficiency in other major languages such as French and Russian is beneficial, as it enhances their ability to engage with a diverse range of stakeholders and understand various cultural contexts.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a mix of legal, academic, and international governance (IGO) backgrounds are particularly well-suited for this role. Their experience in law provides a solid foundation for addressing human rights issues, while academic expertise allows for in-depth analysis and innovative solutions.

This diversity is crucial for fostering a democratic and equitable international order, as it ensures that the Independent Expert can represent and understand the needs of various global communities.

5. **Age and Experience**: While age is not the sole determinant of a candidate's suitability, a range of ages among the successful candidates (from 43 to 65) suggests a balance between seasoned experience and fresh perspectives. This mix is beneficial for addressing complex international issues with a comprehensive approach.

In summary, the ideal candidates for this role in the UNHRC are those who possess a strong multilingual capability, a diverse and relevant professional background, active engagement in pertinent fields, representation from various cultural and geographical contexts, and a blend of experience levels.
