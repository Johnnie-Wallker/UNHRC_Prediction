1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, with the youngest being 43 years old and the oldest being 78 years old. This indicates that experience across a broad spectrum of professional life is valued, suggesting that both seasoned professionals and those with a slightly lesser tenure but significant contributions are considered.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are required to possess proficiency in major international languages. Notably, English fluency is a common trait among all candidates, with additional fluency in French, Russian, and Spanish observed in some candidates. This highlights the importance of multilingualism to effectively engage with a global audience and navigate the diverse linguistic landscape of the UN.

3. **Gender Balance**: The summary does not provide information on the gender distribution among the shortlisted candidates. To assess any potential gender bias, a detailed breakdown of the gender proportion among the candidates would be necessary.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from diverse regions including the United States and Cuba, India, Azerbaijan, and Switzerland. This diversity underscores the UN's commitment to global representation and the importance of varied cultural and geopolitical perspectives in fulfilling the mandate.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal backgrounds of the candidates vary, with some having studied international law and others focusing on regional or national legal systems. This suggests that a broad understanding of legal traditions, whether international or specific to certain regions, is beneficial but not exclusively determinative of success.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the candidates spans across various global locations, including institutions in OECD countries and those in the Global South. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that a broad educational exposure, encompassing different legal and cultural environments, is valued. It suggests that candidates who have studied in diverse settings are likely to bring a more comprehensive and globally relevant perspective to their roles.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Independent Expert role in the UNHRC favor candidates with a broad age range, multilingual capabilities, diverse national and educational backgrounds, and a mix of international and regional legal expertise. This approach ensures a balanced and globally representative composition, enhancing the effectiveness of the mandate in promoting a democratic and equitable international order.
