The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) within the UNHRC from Western European and other States exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and operational requirements of the role. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates demonstrated a robust mix of professional experiences, including legal, academic, and governmental backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to the multifaceted issues related to the right to development.

2. **International and Governmental Experience**: Candidates with significant involvement in International Governmental Organizations (IGOs) and governmental roles were favored. This experience is crucial for navigating the complex international political landscape and effectively advocating for and implementing development rights.

3. **Language Proficiency**: High proficiency in English and French was a common trait among the successful candidates. This linguistic capability is essential for effective communication and collaboration within the diverse and multilingual environment of the UNHRC.

4. **Age and Experience**: While age is not the sole determinant, candidates with a mature age profile, typically in their late 50s to early 60s, were selected. This age bracket often correlates with extensive experience and a well-established professional network, both of which are beneficial for the role.

5. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates were currently engaged in roles that directly or indirectly supported their candidacy for the EMRTD. These roles included academic, governmental, and IGO-related positions, reflecting ongoing engagement with development issues and policy-making processes.

These key features underscore the importance of a balanced blend of legal expertise, international exposure, linguistic skills, and practical experience in the selection of candidates for the EMRTD within the UNHRC.
