The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) within the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, with ages spanning from the early 60s to the mid-80s. This suggests that extensive experience and possibly a long-standing career in relevant fields are valued attributes.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically fluent in multiple major languages, particularly English and French. This multilingual proficiency indicates a requirement for candidates to communicate effectively in the diverse linguistic environment of the UN.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates are exclusively male, indicating a potential gender imbalance in the selection process. This highlights the need for future considerations to ensure a more balanced representation of genders.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from diverse Western European countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. This suggests a preference or advantage for candidates from these regions, possibly due to familiarity with international legal frameworks and human rights mechanisms prevalent in these areas.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' success seems linked to their legal backgrounds rooted in civil law traditions, as indicated by their education and professional experiences in countries with such legal systems. This suggests that candidates with a background in civil law may have an advantage.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of successful candidates is spread across various prestigious universities in Europe, emphasizing the value of education in well-recognized institutions. However, there is no clear trend indicating a preference for education in OECD countries versus global south institutions.

In conclusion, the selection process for the EMRTD within the UNHRC appears to favor candidates with extensive experience, multilingual capabilities, and a strong background in civil law, particularly from Western European countries. Future selection processes should consider these trends while also aiming for greater gender balance and possibly broader regional representation.
