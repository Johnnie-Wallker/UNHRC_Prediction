The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from Western European and other States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and collaboration within the international forum of the UNHRC. Additionally, proficiency in French is highly advantageous, given its widespread use in international relations and legal documentation. While Spanish proficiency is not a primary requirement, some level of ability in this language can be beneficial.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a strong legal background are preferred, as the EMRTD often deals with complex legal frameworks and human rights issues. Furthermore, candidates with a mix of academic, government, IGO (Intergovernmental Organization), and NGO backgrounds bring a well-rounded perspective and expertise that can enhance the mechanism's effectiveness. Academic expertise provides a solid theoretical foundation, while government and IGO experience offer practical insights into policy-making and international cooperation.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to their backgrounds, such as academic positions, government and law-related jobs, or roles within IGOs. This ensures that they are actively involved in relevant fields and can contribute current knowledge and skills to the EMRTD.

4. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, candidates with a significant amount of experience, typically reflected in their age, bring a wealth of knowledge and maturity to the role. This experience is crucial for navigating the complexities of international human rights work.

In summary, the ideal candidates for the EMRTD position within the UNHRC from Western European and other States are those who possess high levels of English and French proficiency, have a robust legal background complemented by diverse professional experiences, are currently employed in relevant fields, and bring a substantial amount of experience to the table. These qualities ensure that they are well-equipped to contribute effectively to the advancement of the right to development on an international scale.
