Based on the provided information, the following key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) within the UN Human Rights Council can be summarized:

1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates tend to be older, with ages ranging from 60 to 86. This suggests a preference for candidates with extensive experience and maturity in the field of international law and human rights.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically fluent in English and French, which are major languages in international diplomacy and law. Spanish proficiency, while present, is less emphasized, indicated by lower levels among some candidates.

3. **Gender**: The information provided does not indicate a gender bias, as specific details about gender were not mentioned. However, the summary should ideally include data on the proportion of male to female candidates to ensure a balanced representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from Western European countries, particularly Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, were shortlisted. This suggests a regional preference for candidates from these countries, which are known for their strong legal systems and international engagement.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, as indicated by the candidates' educational backgrounds and professional experiences, appears to be a significant factor. Candidates with a strong grounding in international law, particularly those who have taught or practiced in prestigious universities and international institutions, are more likely to be successful.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of educational locations does not seem to be a limiting factor. Candidates have studied and taught in various prestigious institutions across different countries, including those in OECD countries and other regions. This suggests that a broad educational background is valued, as long as the institutions are reputable and the education is relevant to international law and human rights.

In conclusion, the selection process for the EMRTD within the UNHRC appears to favor candidates who are older, highly proficient in English and French, from Western European countries, with strong backgrounds in international law, and educated in diverse and reputable institutions. Further data on gender distribution would enhance the clarity of the selection criteria.
