The summary of the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and preferences in the selection process:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to be relatively experienced, with ages ranging from the mid-30s to the mid-70s. This suggests a preference for candidates who have accumulated significant experience in human rights and related fields, potentially indicating a need for both seasoned professionals and those with a long-term commitment to the field.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, with most candidates demonstrating a high level of proficiency in this language. Additionally, proficiency in French and Spanish varies among the candidates, indicating that while English is crucial, knowledge of other major languages relevant to international human rights discourse is also valued.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates are all female, which suggests a potential gender bias in favor of female candidates for this particular mandate. This could reflect a specific need or preference within the UNHRC for female perspectives on issues of racism and discrimination.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Africa, the United States, France, and Brazil. This indicates a preference for geographical diversity, ensuring a broad perspective on global issues of racism and discrimination. However, the specific representation from each region might indicate a slight advantage for candidates from regions historically underrepresented or directly affected by issues of racism and discrimination.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal backgrounds of the candidates vary, with some having studied in common law jurisdictions (e.g., United States, United Kingdom) and others in civil law jurisdictions (e.g., France). This suggests that the UNHRC values a mix of legal traditions, potentially to address issues from multiple legal and cultural perspectives.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the candidates is spread across various global locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the UNHRC values exposure to different educational environments and legal systems, which can provide a broader and more inclusive perspective on human rights issues.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC appears to favor candidates who are experienced, multilingual, and from diverse geographical and legal backgrounds. The predominance of female candidates and the emphasis on English proficiency, alongside knowledge of other major languages, are notable trends. These preferences ensure that the selected candidates can effectively address and represent a wide range of issues related to racism, discrimination, and intolerance on a global scale.
