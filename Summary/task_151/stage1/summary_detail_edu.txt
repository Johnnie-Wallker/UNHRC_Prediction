The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several notable trends and characteristics:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from relatively young (around 35 years old) to more experienced (around 70 years old). This suggests that a broad spectrum of experience is valued, with no specific age limit being a prerequisite for success.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English, with many also possessing proficiency in other major languages such as French and Spanish. This multilingual capability is crucial for the mandate, given the international and diverse nature of the UNHRC.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This reflects the UNHRC's commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities and regions, including Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. This diversity underscores the global nature of the mandate and the importance of representing various cultural and legal traditions.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in various legal traditions have been successful, including common law (e.g., from the United States and the United Kingdom) and civil law (e.g., from France and Spain). This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is beneficial but not exclusively determinant.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates spans both developed countries (e.g., the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) and developing countries (e.g., Brazil and Tanzania). This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UNHRC values exposure to different educational environments and perspectives.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur in the UNHRC emphasizes a balanced approach that considers age, language proficiency, gender diversity, regional representation, legal traditions, and educational diversity. This holistic approach ensures that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address the complex and global issues related to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance.
