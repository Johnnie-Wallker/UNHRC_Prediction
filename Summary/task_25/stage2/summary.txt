The successful candidates for the role of Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication within the international arena. Additionally, they possess proficiency in other major languages such as French and Arabic, enhancing their ability to engage with a diverse range of stakeholders.

2. **Legal Expertise**: All successful candidates have a strong legal background, reflecting the critical need for a deep understanding of legal frameworks and human rights principles related to privacy.

3. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The successful candidates come from varied professional backgrounds, including international governmental organizations (IGOs), government, academia, and NGOs. This diversity ensures a broad perspective and the ability to navigate complex international relations and policy-making processes.

4. **Relevant Current Experience**: Candidates currently engaged in roles related to international law, governance, and human rights are favored. This includes those working in IGOs, academia, NGOs, and government positions, particularly where their work intersects with legal and human rights issues.

5. **Age and Experience**: While there is a spread in age among the successful candidates, ranging from the late 40s to the mid-60s, this range suggests a preference for candidates who have accumulated substantial experience and maturity in their fields, balanced with the energy and adaptability of younger candidates.

These key features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes in the UNHRC, emphasizing the need for multilingual legal experts with diverse and relevant professional experiences.
