1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from Africa in the UNHRC exhibit a wide age range, typically spanning from the mid-30s to late 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential of younger candidates who bring fresh perspectives and innovative approaches.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates generally possess high proficiency in English and French, which are key languages in international diplomacy and human rights discourse. Fluency in these languages is crucial for effective communication and participation in global forums. Arabic is also noted in some cases, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the African continent.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced representation of gender. This reflects the UN's commitment to gender equality in its appointments and ensures diverse viewpoints and experiences are considered.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates are represented from diverse African countries, including Algeria, Uganda, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Botswana, Burundi, Senegal, and Nigeria. This diversity underscores the importance of regional representation and the recognition of indigenous rights issues across different parts of Africa.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in law, particularly international human rights law, are prevalent among the shortlisted individuals. This suggests that a legal background, especially one that focuses on human rights and international law, is advantageous for this mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from both within and outside Africa, including prestigious institutions in the OECD countries, is represented. This indicates that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued, allowing candidates to bring a wide range of perspectives and international connections to the role.

In summary, the selection process for EMRIP members in the UNHRC emphasizes a balance of age, language proficiency, gender, and regional diversity, with a strong preference for candidates who have a legal background in human rights and have studied in diverse educational settings.
