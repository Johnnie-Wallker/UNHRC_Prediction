1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 36 to 53 years old, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively so, as younger candidates are also considered.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English and Russian appears to be a significant requirement for the mandate, as all successful candidates possess high levels in these languages. This suggests that proficiency in these major languages is crucial for effective communication and negotiation within the UN framework.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a slight skew towards male candidates. This suggests a slight gender bias, although the presence of female candidates indicates an effort towards inclusivity.

4. **Nationality and Region**: The majority of successful candidates are from Russia, indicating a regional preference or a higher representation of qualified candidates from this region. This could reflect the specific needs of the mandate related to the regions in question.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong legal background, particularly in law related to international and constitutional matters, are favored. This is evident from the educational and professional backgrounds of the candidates, who have studied and worked extensively in legal fields relevant to the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of educational locations does not seem to be a decisive factor, as candidates have studied in various regions including Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. This suggests that the quality and relevance of education, rather than its geographical location, are more critical considerations.

In summary, the selection process for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC favors candidates with a strong legal background, proficiency in English and Russian, and a mix of experience and maturity, with a slight preference towards candidates from specific regions like Russia.
