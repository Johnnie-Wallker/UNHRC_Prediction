Some also possess additional language skills, particularly French and Spanish, which are beneficial for engaging with a broader range of countries and stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates have a mix of legal, academic, and non-governmental organization (NGO) backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of the legal frameworks, academic research, and practical field experience related to racism and discrimination.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Most successful candidates are currently employed in roles that are directly related to their backgrounds, such as academic positions, government roles, or NGO work. This indicates their active engagement and continued expertise in human rights issues.

4. **Age and Experience**: The candidates range in age, reflecting a balance between seasoned professionals and those with a robust track record of experience. This mix ensures a blend of fresh perspectives and deep, established expertise in human rights advocacy.
