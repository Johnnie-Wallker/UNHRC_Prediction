The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, spanning from the early 30s to the early 60s. This indicates that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential for fresh perspectives from younger candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are typically fluent in multiple languages, with a strong emphasis on English and other major international languages such as French, Spanish, and Chinese. This multilingual capability is crucial for the mandate, given the global scope of the issues addressed.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This balance helps ensure a diverse range of perspectives and approaches to addressing the mandate's issues.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Russia, the United States, India, Botswana, China, and the Philippines. This diversity reflects the global nature of the mandate and the importance of understanding and addressing issues related to racism and discrimination across different cultural and legal contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal backgrounds vary, with some educated in civil law countries and others in common law countries. This suggests that a blend of legal traditions is valued, allowing for a comprehensive approach to human rights issues that span different legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the candidates is spread across various regions, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UNHRC values exposure to different educational environments and perspectives, which can enrich the understanding and handling of global human rights issues.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role emphasizes a balance of age, language proficiency, gender, and regional diversity, as well as a mix of legal traditions and educational backgrounds. These factors collectively contribute to the selection of candidates who are well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted issues related to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance on a global scale.
