The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and documentation within the international arena. Some candidates also possess additional language skills, particularly in Spanish, which enhances their ability to engage with a broader range of stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The selected candidates have a mix of legal, academic, NGO, and sometimes government backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand and the ability to approach the mandate from various perspectives, including legal frameworks, academic research, and practical field experience.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently engaged in academic, legal, NGO, or government roles are favored, as these positions reflect active involvement in the field of human rights and related areas. This experience is crucial for addressing the complexities of racism and discrimination effectively.

4. **Age and Experience**: While age is not the sole determinant, candidates with a range of ages from mid-career to more experienced levels are represented. This balance ensures a blend of fresh perspectives and seasoned expertise.

5. **Geographical Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse geographical regions, which is important for ensuring that the Special Rapporteur can address global issues with a nuanced understanding of regional contexts.

In summary, the ideal candidates for this role are those who possess strong linguistic skills, particularly in English and preferably additional languages, have a robust and varied professional background in relevant fields, are currently active in their respective domains, and represent a range of geographical and cultural perspectives. These qualities collectively equip them to effectively fulfill the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance.
