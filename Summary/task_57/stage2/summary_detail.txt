1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the mid-30s to the early 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential of younger candidates who bring fresh perspectives and innovative approaches to the mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is consistent with the primary working language of the UN. Additionally, some candidates have demonstrated proficiency in other major languages such as French, Spanish, and Russian, indicating a preference for multilingual candidates who can engage with a broader audience and understand diverse cultural contexts.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process is not overtly biased towards one gender. The proportion of each gender appears to be relatively balanced, reflecting the UN's commitment to gender equality in leadership roles.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Russia, the United States, India, Botswana, and the Philippines. This diversity indicates that candidates from various regions and cultural backgrounds are considered, emphasizing the importance of global representation and understanding in addressing issues of racism and discrimination.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law and human rights are more likely to be successful. This includes those educated and working in institutions that follow different legal traditions, such as civil law, common law, and mixed legal systems. The ability to navigate and understand various legal frameworks is crucial for the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in both OECD countries and the global south are represented, indicating that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued. This suggests that the UNHRC appreciates candidates who have been exposed to a variety of educational environments and legal systems, which can enhance their ability to address complex global issues.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance emphasizes a balance of experience and innovation, multilingual proficiency, gender equality, regional diversity, familiarity with various legal traditions, and exposure to diverse educational settings. These factors collectively contribute to the selection of candidates who are well-equipped to address the mandate's challenges effectively.
