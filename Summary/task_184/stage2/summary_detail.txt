1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from early 30s to over 60, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively so. This suggests a balanced consideration of both youthful dynamism and seasoned expertise.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English, with varying levels of proficiency in other languages such as Arabic, French, and Spanish. This reflects the multilingual nature of the UN and the need for candidates to communicate effectively across different regions and linguistic contexts.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This suggests that the UNHRC is committed to gender equality in its appointments, ensuring diverse perspectives and experiences.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions including the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, and Oceania. This highlights the UNHRC's commitment to global representation and the recognition of expertise from various geographical and cultural backgrounds.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While there is no strict adherence to a particular legal tradition, candidates with backgrounds in law, particularly international law and human rights, seem to have an advantage. This is likely due to the legal and policy-oriented nature of the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south, are represented among the shortlisted candidates. This indicates that the UNHRC values educational diversity and recognizes the importance of global academic exposure in preparing candidates for international roles.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities in the UNHRC emphasizes a balance of age, language proficiency, gender equality, global representation, legal expertise, and educational diversity. These factors collectively contribute to the selection of candidates who are well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted issues related to disability rights on an international scale.
