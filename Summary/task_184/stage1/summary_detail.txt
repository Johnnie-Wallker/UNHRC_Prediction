1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, with individuals aged from their early 30s to their late 50s. This suggests that a diverse age spectrum is valued, reflecting a balance between experience and fresh perspectives.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, including English and at least one other language, such as Spanish, French, or Arabic. This multilingual proficiency is crucial for effectively engaging with diverse stakeholders and understanding regional contexts.
