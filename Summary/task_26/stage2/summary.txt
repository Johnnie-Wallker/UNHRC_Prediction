The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrated a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and documentation within the international arena. Additionally, some candidates also possessed intermediate to high levels of proficiency in other major languages such as French and Arabic, enhancing their ability to engage with diverse stakeholders and understand regional nuances.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The selected candidates came from varied professional backgrounds, including legal, academic, international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government sectors. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted issues related to violence against women and allows for a holistic approach to addressing its causes and consequences.

3. **Relevant Current Experience**: Candidates currently engaged in roles related to IGOs, NGOs, or academic and legal fields were favored. This reflects the importance of having active professionals who are directly involved in human rights advocacy, policy-making, or research, thereby ensuring up-to-date knowledge and practical experience in the field.

4. **Age and Maturity**: While age was not a definitive criterion, the presence of candidates with a range of experiences across different age groups (from mid-40s to 60s) suggests a preference for individuals with sufficient maturity and extensive professional experience to handle the complexities of the role.

5. **Cultural and Geographical Representation**: Successful candidates represented a broad spectrum of countries and regions, reflecting the global nature of the mandate. This diversity is crucial for ensuring that the Special Rapporteur can effectively address and represent the varied experiences and challenges faced by women globally.

In summary, the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur position emphasizes the need for individuals with strong linguistic skills, diverse and relevant professional backgrounds, active engagement in human rights work, and a balance of experience and cultural representation. These criteria ensure that the chosen candidate is well-equipped to fulfill the mandate effectively and advocate for the rights and protection of women worldwide.
