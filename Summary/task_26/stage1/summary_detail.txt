The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences in the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from mid-40s to mid-60s, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusively tied to advanced age. This suggests a balanced consideration of both seasoned professionals and those who may bring a mix of experience and contemporary perspectives.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically fluent in multiple major languages, including English, French, and Spanish, reflecting the multilingual nature of the UN's operations and the global scope of the mandate. Proficiency in Arabic also appears to be a significant advantage, particularly given the regional focus of some candidates.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both male and female individuals, with a slight predominance of female candidates. This balance suggests that while gender is considered, the selection is not solely gender-biased, and competence and relevant experience are prioritized.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and North America. This diversity underscores the importance of global representation and understanding of regional contexts in addressing violence against women. Countries like Jordan, India, and Spain are notably represented, indicating a mix of both developed and developing regions.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law and civil law, are represented. This suggests that adaptability and a broad understanding of different legal systems are valued, rather than a specific legal tradition.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: Successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This indicates that the selection committee values exposure to different educational environments and perspectives, rather than favoring education solely from prestigious or Western institutions.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on violence against women emphasizes a balance of experience, language proficiency, gender diversity, and global representation. Candidates who demonstrate a broad educational background and understanding of multiple legal traditions are more likely to be successful. The selection also reflects a commitment to addressing the global issue of violence against women with a nuanced and inclusive approach.
