The summary of the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, as observed in the UNHRC meeting, reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, suggesting that experience and maturity are valued but not confined to a specific age group. The ages of the successful candidates range from the early 40s to the early 60s, indicating a preference for candidates who have accumulated substantial professional experience without being restricted to the oldest age groups.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in major international languages, particularly English and French, which are widely used in international legal and diplomatic contexts. Some candidates also demonstrated proficiency in additional languages such as Spanish and Arabic, which may be beneficial given the global scope of the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process is not overtly biased towards one gender, aiming for inclusivity and diversity in gender representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities and regions, including North America, Europe, Africa, and South America. This diversity reflects the global nature of the mandate and the need for a broad understanding of slavery issues across different cultural and legal contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a background in common law and civil law traditions were both represented among the successful candidates. This indicates that a diverse legal background is valued, allowing for a comprehensive approach to addressing slavery issues that span various legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates was spread across various regions, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the selection committee values exposure to different legal and cultural environments, which can enhance the candidate's ability to address complex global issues.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur position appears to prioritize a balance of experience, language proficiency, gender diversity, and a broad understanding of global legal and cultural contexts. The shortlisted candidates reflect a range of ages, language skills, and educational and professional backgrounds, ensuring a comprehensive approach to the mandate.
