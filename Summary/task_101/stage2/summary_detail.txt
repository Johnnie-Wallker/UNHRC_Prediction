1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 43 to 62 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for suitability.

2. **Language Abilities**: All candidates are highly proficient in English, which is a critical requirement given the international nature of the UNHRC. Some candidates also possess basic Spanish language skills, indicating that multilingual abilities, even at a foundational level, can be advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a slight skew towards female candidates. This indicates a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process, though the specific proportion of each gender is not provided.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from diverse regions are represented, including Europe (Sweden), North America (United States), and Asia (Philippines). This suggests that geographical diversity is valued, and no single region or country has a distinct advantage.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with legal backgrounds from various legal traditions are successful, including those educated in common law (United States, Australia) and civil law (Norway, Argentina, Switzerland). This indicates that a broad legal education and understanding are beneficial, rather than a specific legal tradition.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries and global south institutions, reflecting a preference for educational diversity. This suggests that the breadth of educational exposure, rather than the specific location, is a key factor in candidate success.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples values experience, language proficiency, gender balance, geographical diversity, a broad legal education, and educational diversity. These factors collectively contribute to the selection of candidates who can effectively advocate for and represent the rights of indigenous peoples on an international stage.
