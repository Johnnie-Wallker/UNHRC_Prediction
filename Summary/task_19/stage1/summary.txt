The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from Africa in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and operational requirements of the role. These features can serve as a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates typically possess high levels of proficiency in English and French, which are the two working languages of the UNHRC. Additionally, fluency in Arabic is often advantageous, given its widespread use in many African countries. This multilingual capability ensures effective communication and engagement with diverse indigenous communities and stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates who have demonstrated experience in multiple sectors are preferred. These sectors include legal, NGO, government, IGO, and academic backgrounds. This diversity of experience equips candidates with a comprehensive understanding of the various dimensions of indigenous rights and the practical challenges in their implementation.

3. **Relevant Current Job Experience**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are closely related to the mandate of EMRIP. These roles often involve advocacy, legal practice, policy development, or academic research related to human rights, particularly those of indigenous peoples. This current engagement ensures that candidates are actively involved and up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

4. **Geographical Representation**: There is a noticeable representation from various African countries, reflecting the diverse contexts and challenges faced by indigenous peoples across the continent. This geographical diversity is crucial for ensuring that the Expert Mechanism can address issues comprehensively and representatively.

5. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, candidates with a mix of younger professionals and seasoned experts are selected. This balance ensures a blend of fresh perspectives and deep, seasoned insights into the complexities of indigenous rights.

In summary, the selection of candidates for EMRIP in the UNHRC emphasizes multilingual proficiency, diverse and relevant professional backgrounds, active engagement in related fields, geographical representation, and a balanced mix of age and experience. These criteria collectively ensure that the selected candidates are well-equipped to contribute effectively to the protection and promotion of indigenous rights in Africa.
