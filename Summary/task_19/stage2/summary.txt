The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from Africa in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are widely spoken in Africa and are essential for effective communication within the UN framework. Some candidates also exhibit proficiency in Arabic, which is significant given the geographical distribution of Arabic-speaking countries in Africa.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates possess a mix of backgrounds including legal, academic, IGO (International Governmental Organization), NGO (Non-Governmental Organization), and government experience. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of indigenous rights issues from various perspectives and practical experience in implementing related policies and programs.

3. **Relevant Current Job Experience**: Many successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly or indirectly related to human rights, law, or academic research, which are crucial for contributing to the expert discussions and policy recommendations within EMRIP.

4. **Geographical Representation**: The candidates come from a variety of African countries, ensuring a broad representation that reflects the diverse experiences and challenges faced by indigenous peoples across the continent.

5. **Age and Experience**: While there is a range in age, the majority of successful candidates have accumulated significant professional experience, which is beneficial for their role in providing expert advice and insights on complex human rights issues.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the importance of language skills, professional diversity, current relevant experience, geographical representation, and a balance of age and experience to effectively serve the mandate of EMRIP within the UNHRC.
