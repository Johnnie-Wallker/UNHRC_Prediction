1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from Africa in the UNHRC exhibit a wide age range, with candidates aged from the mid-40s to late 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for suitability.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English and French, which are major languages in international diplomacy and legal contexts. Arabic is also seen in candidates from certain regions, indicating the importance of language skills that align with global and regional communication needs.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced representation in terms of gender. This suggests that the selection process is inclusive and does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse African countries are represented, including Algeria, Uganda, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Botswana, Burundi, and Senegal. This diversity reflects the regional spread of expertise and a commitment to including voices from various parts of Africa.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in law, particularly international human rights law, and those who have studied or worked in environments with strong legal traditions, such as those in Europe and North America, tend to be more successful. This indicates a preference for candidates who are well-versed in international legal frameworks relevant to indigenous rights.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have often pursued education in both African and international institutions, including those in Europe and North America. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that a global perspective and exposure to different legal and cultural contexts are beneficial for the role.

In summary, the selection criteria for EMRIP members from Africa in the UNHRC favor candidates who are mature, multilingual, and have a strong background in international human rights law. They also value diversity in terms of gender and nationality, and appreciate candidates who have studied or worked in various global settings.
