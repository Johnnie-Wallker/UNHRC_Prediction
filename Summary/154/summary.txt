1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 34 to 53, indicating a mix of younger and more experienced professionals. This suggests that age is not a decisive factor, but rather a diversity of experience is valued. Language abilities are also diverse, with candidates demonstrating proficiency in English, French, and even low proficiency in English (for the Algerian candidate). This indicates that while multilingualism is beneficial, high proficiency in English is particularly valued, as it is the working language of the UN.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both men and women, suggesting that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process. The inclusion of candidates from various gender backgrounds indicates a commitment to gender diversity.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse African countries (Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo), which underscores the importance of representing different African states in the UNHRC. This suggests that nationality plays a role in ensuring geographical representation and diversity within the mechanism.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The legal traditions of the successful candidates are varied, with education backgrounds from both common law and civil law jurisdictions. This diversity in legal education and practice suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is valued, reflecting the international nature of the UNHRC and the need to address human rights issues from multiple legal perspectives.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., Germany, USA) and universities in the global south (e.g., Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria). This indicates that the location of education is not a limiting factor; rather, the quality of education and relevance to human rights and international law are more critical. The diversity in educational backgrounds also contributes to a broader understanding and approach to human rights issues.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a mix of age, gender, and national diversity, reflecting the UNHRC's commitment to inclusivity and representation. Their educational backgrounds, spanning various legal traditions and geographical locations, underscore the importance of a comprehensive and diverse understanding of human rights law and practice.
