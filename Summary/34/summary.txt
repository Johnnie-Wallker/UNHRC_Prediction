1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - **Age**: The successful candidates range in age from 42 to 70 years old, indicating that both younger and older candidates can be successful. However, the majority of successful candidates are in their 60s, suggesting a slight preference for more experienced individuals.
   - **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates generally have high English proficiency, which is crucial given the international nature of the role. Some also possess high French proficiency, which could be beneficial due to the historical ties of French to international law and the United Nations. Other languages, such as Arabic and Spanish, are present but not uniformly among all successful candidates.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating no clear gender advantage. This suggests that the selection process is gender-neutral and focuses on qualifications and experience.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including the United Kingdom, United States, France, Italy, Australia, and others. This indicates that no single nationality has a significant advantage, and the selection process values diversity and international representation.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (United States, United Kingdom) and civil law (France, Netherlands, Italy). This suggests that the selection process does not favor one legal tradition over another but rather values a broad understanding of international law and human rights.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - Successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries and the global south, including universities in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, and others. This indicates that the selection process values education from diverse locations, reflecting a broad and inclusive understanding of international law and human rights.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 exhibit a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, legal traditions, and educational backgrounds. The selection process appears to value experience, language proficiency, diversity, and a broad understanding of international law and human rights, regardless of specific national or educational backgrounds.
