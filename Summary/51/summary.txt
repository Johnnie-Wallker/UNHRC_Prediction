1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 40 to 59, indicating a preference for candidates who are experienced but not necessarily very senior (e.g., over 60).
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with high proficiency in English being common, and varying levels of proficiency in other languages such as French, Spanish, and Arabic. This suggests that while English proficiency is important, multilingual abilities are valued but not strictly necessary.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating that gender does not appear to be a determining factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Brazil, United Kingdom, Nigeria, Georgia, India, United States), suggesting that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage. The selection appears to be based on merit and experience rather than nationality.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have educational backgrounds and professional experiences that span common law, civil law, and international law traditions. This diversity suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is valued, rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The education of the successful candidates is spread across various regions, including both OECD countries and the global south. This indicates that the location of education is not a decisive factor; what matters more is the relevance and quality of the education in relation to human rights and international law.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the United Nations Human Rights Council are characterized by their diverse backgrounds, including age, language abilities, gender, nationality, legal traditions, and locations of education. The selection process seems to prioritize experience, expertise in human rights, and the ability to understand and operate within various legal and cultural contexts.
