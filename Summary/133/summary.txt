1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates show a mix in age, with one candidate being 36 years old and another 53, indicating that both younger and more experienced candidates can be successful. In terms of language abilities, all successful candidates have high English levels, which suggests that proficiency in English is a significant advantage in this context.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female applicants (3 males and 1 female), indicating that gender does not appear to be a decisive factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**: All successful candidates are from Russia or Ukraine, suggesting a potential advantage for candidates from these countries, possibly due to a stronger representation of indigenous issues within these regions or a better alignment with the specific needs and contexts of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in law, particularly in areas relevant to human rights and international law. This suggests that candidates with a legal background, especially those who have studied or worked in areas related to indigenous rights and international law, are more likely to be successful.

5. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education among the successful candidates is not explicitly noted as a factor. However, the candidates' educational backgrounds are diverse, ranging from local institutions in their respective countries to more international settings like the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This suggests that a broad educational background, including both local and international exposure, can be beneficial.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples show a preference for those with high English proficiency, legal backgrounds in human rights and international law, and possibly those from Russia and Ukraine. Gender does not seem to be a significant factor, and a diverse educational background, including both local and international exposure, is beneficial.
