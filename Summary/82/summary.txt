1. **Age or Language Abilities**: Among the successful candidates (0aa188, a2557a, cfecdb), there is no clear trend regarding age since the ages are unknown for two candidates and 56 for the third. However, all successful candidates possess high levels of both English and Russian, indicating that language proficiency in these languages is a significant factor.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include two females (0aa188, a2557a) and one male (cfecdb). This suggests that gender does not necessarily confer an advantage; rather, the selection is gender-balanced, reflecting a diverse representation.

3. **Nationality**: All successful candidates are from Russia, indicating a potential advantage for Russian nationals in this specific context of selection for roles related to indigenous peoples in Central and Eastern Europe, the Russian Federation, Central Asia, and Transcaucasia.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including civil law and international law. Candidate a2557a has a strong background in civil and financial law, while candidate cfecdb has extensive experience in international relations and representation in international fora. This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal traditions, particularly in relation to international standards and indigenous rights, is beneficial.

5. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is primarily from institutions within Russia, with no clear pattern favoring education from OECD countries or the global south. This indicates that the relevance and quality of education within the region are highly valued, rather than the geographic location of the educational institution.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) demonstrate a strong proficiency in English and Russian, a balanced representation of gender, and a preference for candidates from the region, particularly Russia. Their educational and professional backgrounds reflect a diversity of legal traditions and experiences relevant to indigenous rights and international relations.
