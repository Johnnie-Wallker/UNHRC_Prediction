1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates exhibit a mix of ages, ranging from 44 to 70, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, there is a trend towards candidates with high proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are common languages in international human rights discourse.

2. **Gender**: The shortlisted candidates are predominantly female, suggesting a slight advantage for female candidates in this selection process. This could reflect a trend towards gender diversity in high-level UN positions or specific qualities perceived as advantageous in female candidates for these roles.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Lebanon, the United States, South Africa, Switzerland/Sweden, and Egypt. This diversity indicates that no single nationality has a distinct advantage, emphasizing the importance of international representation and experience in the selection criteria.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal backgrounds vary, with education and experience in different legal traditions (common law, civil law). This diversity suggests that adaptability and expertise in international human rights law, rather than a specific national legal tradition, are more critical factors for success.

5. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is spread across various regions, including North America, Europe, and the Middle East. This indicates that the location of education, whether in OECD countries or the global south, does not inherently disadvantage or advantage a candidate. Instead, the quality of education and relevance to human rights and international law are more significant factors.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment position at the UN Human Rights Council are characterized by their diverse backgrounds, high language proficiency, and expertise in international human rights law. Age, gender, nationality, and the specific legal tradition or educational location do not appear to be decisive factors, but rather, the holistic experience and capabilities in human rights advocacy and legal expertise are prioritized.
