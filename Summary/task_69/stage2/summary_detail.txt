The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that are indicative of the selection criteria:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to fall within a mature age range, typically between 40 to 65 years old. This suggests a preference for candidates with a significant amount of experience and maturity in the field of human rights.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, with most candidates demonstrating a high level of proficiency. Additionally, knowledge of other major languages such as French, Spanish, and Russian is beneficial but not uniformly necessary. This indicates that while English is crucial, multilingual abilities are valued to engage with a diverse global audience.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This suggests that the UNHRC values diversity and does not show a significant bias towards one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: There is a diverse representation of nationalities among the successful candidates, spanning various regions including Europe, Asia, and North America. This diversity reflects the global mandate of the role and the need to address human rights issues from multiple cultural and legal perspectives.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law and human rights, often educated in countries with significant legal traditions in these areas, are more likely to be successful. This includes education and experience in countries known for their contributions to international law and human rights frameworks.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and global south institutions, are favored. This indicates a preference for candidates who have a broad understanding of human rights issues across different global contexts and legal systems.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role at the UNHRC emphasizes a balance of experience, language proficiency, gender diversity, and a broad educational and professional background that reflects a global perspective on human rights.
