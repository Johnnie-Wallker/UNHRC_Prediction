1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 41 to 60 years old, indicating that experience and maturity are valued across a broad spectrum. This suggests that a diverse age range is considered beneficial for the role, encompassing both seasoned professionals and those with more recent academic and professional experiences.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are proficient primarily in English, with varying levels of proficiency in other languages such as French and Spanish. This indicates that while English is a critical requirement, additional language skills, particularly French, can be advantageous.
