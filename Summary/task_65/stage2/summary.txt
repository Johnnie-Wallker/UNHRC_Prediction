The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from North America in the UN Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication and negotiation within the international forum. Some candidates also possess additional language skills, such as French or Spanish, which can enhance their ability to engage with a broader range of stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates have a mix of legal, academic, government, and international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of both legal frameworks and practical implementation strategies related to indigenous rights.

3. **Relevant Experience**: The candidates have current or recent experience in roles that are directly or indirectly related to indigenous rights, law, and policy. This includes positions in academia, government, and international organizations, as well as roles that involve legal practice or advocacy.

4. **Age and Maturity**: The age range of the candidates, spanning from the early 40s to the early 60s, indicates a balance between energy and experience. This maturity is crucial for navigating complex international negotiations and for providing leadership in the field of indigenous rights.

5. **Geographical Representation**: While all candidates are from North America, there is a mix of representation from both the United States and Canada, reflecting the diverse indigenous populations and issues across these countries.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the importance of linguistic ability, professional diversity, relevant experience, maturity, and geographical representation in identifying candidates who are well-suited to contribute effectively to the work of the EMRIP within the UN Human Rights Council.
