1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates' ages range from the mid-30s to the mid-70s, indicating that both younger and older candidates can be successful.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with successful candidates demonstrating proficiency in multiple languages, including English, French, Arabic, and Spanish. This suggests that multilingualism is advantageous but not strictly necessary.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating that gender does not appear to be a significant factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - Successful candidates come from various countries, including Sudan, United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands, and Mauritius. This diversity suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (UK, US), civil law (France, Sudan), and international law. This indicates that familiarity with different legal systems can be beneficial.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - Successful candidates have been educated in both OECD countries (e.g., UK, US, France, Netherlands) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Sudan, Zimbabwe). This diversity suggests that the location of education does not necessarily determine success, but a broad and diverse educational background can be advantageous.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, and educational backgrounds. The selection process appears to value diversity and a broad understanding of different legal traditions and educational experiences, rather than privileging any single factor.
