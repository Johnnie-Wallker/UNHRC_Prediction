The shortlisted candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar in the United Nations Human Rights Council are d93ed5 (female, 47 years old, high English and French levels, Norwegian and United Kingdom citizenship), d79aac (male, 67 years old, high English level, United States citizenship), and 6aab12 (male, 75 years old, high English level, Indonesian citizenship).

1. **Trend in Age or Language Abilities**: The successful candidates show a wide range in age, with one candidate in their 40s, another in their 60s, and the third in their 70s. This suggests that age is not a decisive factor in the selection process. Regarding language abilities, all three candidates have high English proficiency, which is crucial for international diplomacy and legal work within the UN framework. The female candidate (d93ed5) also has high French proficiency, which might be beneficial given the importance of French in international law and diplomacy.

2. **Gender Advantage**: The shortlisted candidates include one female and two males. This distribution does not strongly indicate a gender advantage, suggesting that the selection process is relatively balanced in terms of gender.

3. **Nationality Advantage**: The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities (Norwegian and United Kingdom, United States, and Indonesia). This diversity suggests that the selection committee values a broad international perspective and does not favor any particular nationality over others.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal traditions vary based on their educational backgrounds and professional experiences. Candidate d93ed5 has a strong background in international law from prestigious institutions in the UK and the US, reflecting a common law tradition. Candidate d79aac has a diverse background including political and social sciences, and candidate 6aab12 has a focus on international law and has served in various UN roles, reflecting a mix of common and international legal traditions. This diversity in legal backgrounds might be seen as advantageous for addressing complex human rights issues in Myanmar.

5. **Location of Education or Diversity of Education**: The candidates have studied in various locations, including the UK, US, and within their own countries. This diversity in educational backgrounds, including institutions in both OECD countries and the global south, suggests that the committee values a broad educational foundation and does not necessarily favor education from specific regions.

In summary, the selection of these candidates reflects a preference for diversity in terms of age, gender, nationality, and educational backgrounds, ensuring a broad and inclusive approach to addressing human rights issues in Myanmar. The emphasis on high English proficiency and diverse legal and educational backgrounds underscores the importance of international experience and adaptability in the role of Special Rapporteur.
