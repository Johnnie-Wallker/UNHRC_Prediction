1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 45 to 66, indicating a preference for candidates with substantial experience but not necessarily the oldest.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with proficiency in English being a common factor, and varying levels of proficiency in other languages such as French, Arabic, and Spanish. This suggests that while English proficiency is important, a broad linguistic skill set is not strictly necessary.

2. **Gender**:
   - All successful candidates are female, indicating a clear gender advantage for women in this selection process. This could reflect a commitment to gender equality or a specific focus on women's issues within the role of Special Rapporteur.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities including India, Peru, Egypt, Croatia, and Afghanistan. This indicates no specific nationality advantage and a preference for a global representation.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have a mix of legal backgrounds, including international law, human rights law, and public administration. This diversity suggests that a broad legal background, particularly in human rights and international law, is advantageous.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The education of the successful candidates is spread across various regions, including both OECD countries and the global south. This indicates that the location of education is not a decisive factor, but rather the relevance and quality of the education in areas related to human rights and international law.

In summary, the successful candidates for the role of Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes, and consequences in the United Nations Human Rights Council are characterized by a range of ages, diverse nationalities, and varied educational backgrounds. The common threads among them are proficiency in English, a strong background in human rights and international law, and a gender advantage favoring women. The selection process appears to value experience, relevant expertise, and a global perspective.
