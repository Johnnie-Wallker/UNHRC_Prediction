Based on the provided information, the following key features of successful candidates for the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination within the UNHRC can be summarized:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 49 to 72 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age bracket, are valued in this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple languages, particularly English and Spanish, with some also proficient in French. This multilingual proficiency indicates a need for candidates who can communicate effectively across different linguistic contexts relevant to the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The information provided does not specify the gender of the candidates, making it impossible to assess any gender bias based on the proportion of each gender. However, the presence of both male and female candidates in the shortlist suggests a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The candidates represent diverse nationalities from Latin American and Caribbean States, including the Dominican Republic, Brazil, and Venezuela. This diversity reflects a preference for regional representation, ensuring that the perspectives and experiences of the region are well-represented in the discussions around human rights and self-determination.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' backgrounds in law and sociology suggest that a legal or social science education, particularly focused on international law and human rights, is advantageous. This aligns with the mandate's focus on legal frameworks and human rights issues.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries (such as the United States and the Netherlands) and non-OECD countries (like Venezuela and Brazil). This indicates that a broad educational background, encompassing both global north and south institutions, is valued, reflecting a need for a global perspective in addressing the mandate's issues.

In summary, the selection process for this mandate within the UNHRC appears to favor candidates with a broad range of experiences, multilingual abilities, and a strong background in relevant fields such as law and sociology. The emphasis on regional representation and a diverse educational background ensures that the Working Group benefits from a wide array of perspectives and expertise.
