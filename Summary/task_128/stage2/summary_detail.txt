Based on the information provided, the following key features of successful candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, member from Eastern European States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, can be summarized:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a relatively narrow age range, with ages predominantly in the mid-30s. This suggests that candidates within this age bracket may have a competitive advantage, possibly due to their combination of experience and energy.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is a common requirement for international roles within the UN. Additionally, some level of proficiency in French is beneficial, though not mandatory, as indicated by the varying levels among the candidates. Spanish proficiency is not a significant factor in the selection.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be balanced, suggesting a fair representation of both sexes.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The candidates are primarily from Eastern European countries, specifically Poland and Hungary. This suggests that candidates from this region may have a slight advantage, possibly due to their familiarity with the regional dynamics and the specific context of the mandate.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The educational backgrounds of the candidates, particularly their legal education and expertise in human rights, seem to be a significant factor in their success. Candidates with a strong legal background, especially in human rights, are more likely to be successful.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of the location of education does not appear to be a decisive factor. Candidates have studied in various locations, including both Eastern European and other international universities. However, a strong legal or human rights education, regardless of the location, seems to be crucial.

In summary, the successful candidates for this mandate within the UNHRC are typically mid-30s professionals with a strong legal and human rights background, high proficiency in English, and a balanced representation of both genders. Candidates from Eastern European countries have a slight advantage, and the location of education is less significant than the quality and relevance of the education received.
