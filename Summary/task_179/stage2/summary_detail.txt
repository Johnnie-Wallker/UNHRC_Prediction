Based on the provided information, the key features of successful candidates for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, member from Latin American and Caribbean States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from 46 to 70. This suggests that extensive experience, rather than a specific age bracket, is valued for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English and a moderate to high level in Spanish. French proficiency, while present, is not uniformly required, indicating that English and Spanish are the major languages of importance for this role.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both male and female representatives, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be balanced, reflecting an inclusive approach.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates are from diverse nationalities within the Latin American and Caribbean region, including Ecuador, Uruguay, and potentially Spain and Italy, indicating that regional representation is crucial. However, the emphasis seems to be more on the Latin American context rather than broader international affiliations.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international, criminal, and human rights law are favored. The legal tradition, as evidenced by the location of education and professional experience, appears to be a significant factor. Candidates educated in both local and international institutions, particularly those with a focus on human rights and international law, are more likely to succeed.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates educated in universities across different regions, including Latin America, the United States, and Europe. This diversity suggests that international exposure and education in prominent institutions, whether in OECD countries or the global south, are beneficial but not exclusively determinant factors.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention emphasize candidates with extensive experience in human rights and international law, proficiency in major international languages (English and Spanish), balanced gender representation, and a strong regional focus within Latin America and the Caribbean. The educational and professional backgrounds of the candidates, encompassing diverse legal traditions and international exposure, are also critical factors in their success.
