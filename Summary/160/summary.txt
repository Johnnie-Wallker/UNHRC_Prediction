1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates show a wide range of ages, from 39 to 81, indicating that both younger and older candidates are considered. In terms of language abilities, there is a mix of high proficiency in English, French, and Arabic, suggesting that language skills are important but not exclusively focused on a particular language.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female applicants (e.g., 90db9d is a female candidate), indicating that gender does not appear to be a decisive factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Egypt, Argentina, Portugal, India, Netherlands, and the United States. This suggests that the selection is not biased towards any particular nationality but values diversity in representation.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates have a mix of legal backgrounds, including international law, human rights, and development law. For instance, candidates like 59f51f and 309928 have extensive experience in international relations and UN bodies, while others like 299fb2 and 563527 have strong academic and legal backgrounds. This diversity in legal traditions suggests that a broad range of legal expertise is valued.

5. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is spread across various locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., London School of Economics, Harvard, Stanford) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Cairo University, University of Pretoria). This indicates that the location of education is not a limiting factor; what matters more is the relevance and quality of the education in relation to human rights and development.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to development show a trend towards diversity in age, language abilities, gender, nationality, legal tradition, and location of education. The selection process appears to value a broad range of experiences and expertise that align with the multifaceted nature of human rights and development issues.
