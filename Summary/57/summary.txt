The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that may have contributed to their selection:

1. **Age and Language Abilities:**
   - The successful candidates range in age from 43 to 63, indicating a preference for candidates with significant experience and maturity.
   - All successful candidates have high English proficiency, which is crucial for international diplomacy and communication within the UN framework. Some also have additional language skills, such as French, Spanish, and Chinese, which enhance their ability to engage with a diverse range of countries and cultures.

2. **Gender Balance:**
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, suggesting that the selection process does not favor one gender over the other. This balance is important for representing diverse perspectives and ensuring inclusivity in human rights advocacy.

3. **Nationality Diversity:**
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Botswana, India, China, the Philippines, and Russia. This diversity reflects the UN's commitment to inclusivity and the representation of different global regions and cultures.

4. **Legal Tradition and Education:**
   - The successful candidates have educational backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (e.g., India, Philippines) and civil law (e.g., Botswana, China, Russia). This suggests that a diverse legal background is valued, allowing for a broader understanding of international legal frameworks and human rights issues.
   - The location of education varies, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries (e.g., University of Westminster, Harvard University) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Peking University, South-central University for Nationalities). This diversity in educational exposure may enhance their ability to address global human rights issues from multiple perspectives.

5. **Diversity of Educational Locations:**
   - The successful candidates have studied in diverse geographical locations, including both developed and developing countries. This indicates that the selection committee values exposure to different educational environments and legal systems, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of global human rights challenges.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur position demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, and nationalities, with a balanced representation of genders. Their diverse educational backgrounds and legal traditions suggest that the selection process values a broad understanding of international law and human rights, as well as the ability to engage with a wide array of global stakeholders.
