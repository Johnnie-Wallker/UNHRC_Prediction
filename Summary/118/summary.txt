1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, suggesting that both younger and more experienced candidates can be successful. For instance, candidates in their 30s (e.g., ID: 82cadb, ID: 59bcda) and those in their 50s and 60s (e.g., ID: cd63a3, ID: b8c37e) have been shortlisted.
   - Language abilities are diverse but generally high, with most candidates possessing high English proficiency and some also having additional language skills such as French, Arabic, and Spanish. This indicates that multilingual candidates, especially those fluent in English and French, have an advantage.

2. **Gender**:
   - Both male and female candidates have been successful, indicating that gender does not appear to be a decisive factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - Candidates from various African countries have been successful, including Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Burundi. This suggests that there is no single nationality that holds an advantage, but rather a diversity of nationalities is represented.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The legal tradition does not seem to be a consistent factor. Candidates have studied in various legal traditions, including common law (e.g., University of Arizona, University of London) and civil law (e.g., Universit¨¦ de Kinshasa, University Cheikh Anta Diop). This indicates that a diverse legal education background is valued.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The location of education is diverse, with successful candidates having studied in both OECD countries (e.g., University of Arizona, Yale University, Clemson University) and universities in the global south (e.g., Nairobi University, Jomo Kenyatta University, University of Yaounde). This suggests that the diversity of educational experiences, both within and outside Africa, is considered valuable.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, and educational backgrounds. Both male and female candidates are represented, and there is no single nationality that dominates. The diversity in legal traditions and the location of education indicate that a broad range of experiences and qualifications are valued in the selection process.
