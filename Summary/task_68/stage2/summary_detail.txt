1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence exhibit a broad age range, spanning from the late 40s to late 50s. This suggests that a mix of seasoned experience and continued vigor in professional activities is valued.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is consistently high among the successful candidates, indicating its crucial importance for the mandate. Additionally, proficiency in Spanish is noted in some candidates, reflecting the relevance of languages spoken in regions often requiring human rights interventions. Other major languages like French are less uniformly represented, suggesting that while beneficial, they are not mandatory.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This balance suggests that the UNHRC values diversity in gender representation among its Special Rapporteurs.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates hail from diverse regions including Latin America, North America, Europe, and Africa. This diversity underscores the UNHRC's commitment to global representation, ensuring that perspectives from various geopolitical contexts are included.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law and human rights, often educated in prestigious institutions across different legal traditions, are favored. This includes those educated in common law jurisdictions like the UK and those with practical experience in transitional justice and human rights law.

6. **Diversity of Education Location**: The successful candidates have been educated in various parts of the world, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the UNHRC values a broad understanding of international human rights issues, derived from varied educational experiences.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Special Rapporteur position emphasize a balance of gender, a broad age range, proficiency in major international languages, diverse national and educational backgrounds, and a strong grounding in international law and human rights practices. These factors collectively ensure a robust and globally informed approach to the mandate.
