1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, with individuals aged from the early 40s to late 50s. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for the role of Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically fluent in English, with varying levels of proficiency in other major languages such as French, Spanish, and Arabic. This indicates that while English is a critical language for the role, fluency in other UN languages can also be advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process is inclusive and does not favor one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. This highlights the importance of global representation and the recognition of expertise from various geographical contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law, human rights, and transitional justice are favored. This includes individuals educated and working in both common law and civil law traditions, indicating a preference for a broad legal perspective rather than a specific legal tradition.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have been educated in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the selection committee values a wide range of educational experiences and perspectives, reflecting the global mandate of the role.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role emphasizes a diverse range of attributes, including age, language proficiency, gender balance, geographical and legal diversity, and a broad educational background. This ensures that the selected candidate is well-equipped to address the complex and global nature of the mandate.
