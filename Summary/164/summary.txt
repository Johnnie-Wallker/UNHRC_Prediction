1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 51 to 70, indicating a preference for experienced professionals.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with high proficiency in English being a common trait among all successful candidates. Some candidates also possess high levels in other languages (e.g., French, Spanish), which might be advantageous but is not uniformly required.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, suggesting no clear gender advantage. Gender diversity is represented, with four women and two men among the shortlisted candidates.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Australia, India, United Kingdom, Austria/Germany, Serbia), indicating no specific nationality has an advantage. This diversity reflects a global representation, which is beneficial for addressing international human rights issues.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - Most successful candidates have a strong background in law, particularly international human rights law. This suggests that candidates with a legal background, especially those educated in common law and civil law traditions, are favored. The legal expertise likely provides a solid foundation for understanding and advocating for human rights.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have been educated in various locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria) and non-OECD countries (e.g., India). This indicates that the diversity in educational backgrounds is valued, and that the location of education does not necessarily determine success. However, education in prestigious institutions with a strong focus on human rights or international law appears to be advantageous.

In summary, successful candidates for the Independent Expert role on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons in the UN Human Rights Council tend to be experienced professionals with a strong legal background in human rights, irrespective of their specific nationality or the exact location of their education. Diversity in both gender and nationality is valued, and while language proficiency in English is crucial, additional language skills can be advantageous.
