This active involvement ensures that they are up-to-date with contemporary issues and can effectively contribute to the mandate.

4. **Age and Experience**: While there is no strict age requirement, successful candidates tend to have a significant amount of experience, typically ranging from mid-40s to late 60s. This experience is crucial for handling the complex and sensitive nature of the mandate.

5. **International Exposure**: Many successful candidates have experience working in or with international settings, which is essential for navigating the global landscape of human rights and legal systems.
