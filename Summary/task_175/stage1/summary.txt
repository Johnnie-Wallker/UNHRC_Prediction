The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of English proficiency, which is essential for effective communication within the international arena. Additionally, candidates with intermediate to high levels of Arabic are favored, reflecting the need to communicate directly with stakeholders in the region. Proficiency in other languages such as French and Spanish can also be advantageous, enhancing the candidate's ability to engage with a broader international community.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a strong blend of legal, academic, and NGO backgrounds are preferred. This combination indicates a comprehensive understanding of human rights issues, legal frameworks, and practical experience in advocacy and policy development. Candidates with experience in international governmental organizations (IGOs) or government roles are also considered valuable, as they bring insights into policy-making and diplomatic processes.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are typically engaged in roles that are directly related to law, academia, or NGOs. This current involvement ensures that candidates remain active and informed about contemporary human rights issues, legal developments, and advocacy strategies, which are crucial for the effective execution of the Special Rapporteur's duties.

4. **Age Diversity**: While there is no strict age requirement, a mix of younger and more experienced candidates is evident in the shortlisted pool. This diversity ensures a range of perspectives and energy levels, balancing fresh insights with seasoned expertise.

5. **Cultural and Geographical Representation**: Candidates with dual citizenship or those representing diverse geographical regions are often favored. This reflects the UNHRC's commitment to inclusivity and the ability to navigate complex cultural and political landscapes, which is particularly relevant given the sensitive nature of the mandate.

In summary, the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur role emphasizes multilingual proficiency, a blend of legal, academic, and NGO backgrounds, relevant current employment, age diversity, and cultural and geographical representation. These criteria ensure that the chosen candidate is well-equipped to address the multifaceted challenges of the mandate and effectively advocate for human rights in the Palestinian territories.
