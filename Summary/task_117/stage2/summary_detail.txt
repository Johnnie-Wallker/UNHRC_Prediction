1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a consistent age range, with all candidates being in their 60s. This suggests that a certain level of maturity and experience is valued for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages. All candidates demonstrate proficiency in English, and most also possess high levels of proficiency in Arabic, with additional capabilities in French, Russian, and possibly Spanish. This indicates a preference for candidates who can navigate and communicate effectively across diverse linguistic environments.

3. **Gender Balance**: The summary does not provide information on the gender of the candidates. However, the focus should be on ensuring a balanced representation of genders to avoid any potential bias and to promote inclusivity within the selection process.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates hail from diverse regions including the Middle East (Kuwait, Yemen) and South Asia (India). This suggests that there is no specific regional bias but rather a preference for candidates who can represent and understand the complexities of different geographical areas, especially those relevant to the mandate of addressing human rights violations and self-determination issues.

5. **Legal Tradition and Success**: The educational backgrounds of the candidates, which include studies in political science, international relations, and law, suggest that a legal or policy-oriented background is beneficial. This is particularly relevant given the mandate's focus on human rights and international law.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: The candidates have studied in various locations including Europe (Munich, Dijon), Africa (Nairobi), and Asia (Madras, Kiev). This diversity in educational settings indicates that exposure to different legal and cultural environments is advantageous. It suggests a preference for candidates who have a broad understanding of global issues and who have been educated in both developed and developing contexts.

In summary, the selection process for this mandate in the UNHRC seems to favor candidates who are mature, multilingual, and possess a diverse and international educational background with a focus on law, political science, or international relations. There is also an emphasis on representing a broad geographical spectrum to ensure comprehensive understanding and advocacy for human rights issues across different regions.
