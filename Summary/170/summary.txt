The shortlisted candidates for the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights in the United Nations Human Rights Council are 024d7f (Morocco), 20aee3 (Belgium), and cfbce4 (Argentina/Italy). Here are the key features and trends among these successful candidates:

1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - **Age**: The successful candidates range in age from 44 (cfbce4) to 52 (20aee3), indicating a preference for candidates in their 40s and 50s.
   - **Language Abilities**: All three candidates possess high proficiency in multiple languages, with 024d7f and cfbce4 showing high proficiency in English, French, and another language (Arabic for 024d7f and Spanish for cfbce4). This suggests a trend towards candidates with strong multilingual abilities, which is beneficial for international diplomacy and communication.

2. **Gender**:
   - The shortlisted candidates are all male, indicating a potential gender bias in the selection process. This could suggest that male candidates currently have an advantage, though this should be considered in the context of the overall pool of candidates.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse geographical backgrounds: North Africa (Morocco), Europe (Belgium), and South America (Argentina/Italy). This diversity in nationality suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, but rather a preference for candidates with international exposure and diverse cultural perspectives.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The legal traditions of the candidates vary, with 024d7f having a background in global sustainability politics and governance, 20aee3 with a focus on economic, social, and cultural rights, and cfbce4 with expertise in international economic law and human rights. This diversity in legal expertise suggests that a broad range of legal traditions are valued, particularly those that intersect with human rights and international cooperation.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The education of the candidates spans both OECD countries and the global south, with 024d7f having studied in Morocco and Finland, 20aee3 in Belgium and the United States, and cfbce4 in Argentina, Spain, and the United States. This indicates that the location and diversity of education are considered valuable, reflecting a global perspective and exposure to different educational systems and legal frameworks.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, strong multilingual abilities, and diverse nationalities and legal traditions. The selection process appears to value candidates with international experience and a broad educational background that includes both OECD countries and the global south. The predominance of male candidates in this shortlist suggests a potential gender bias, which should be addressed to ensure a more balanced representation.
