1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates exhibit a wide range of ages, from 38 to 82, indicating that age is not a decisive factor.
   - Language abilities vary, with high proficiency in English being common among all, and additional proficiency in other languages such as French, Spanish, and Arabic. This suggests that multilingualism, particularly in English, is advantageous.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities including Australia, South Africa, Israel, Brazil, and Romania. This suggests that no single nationality has a distinct advantage; rather, a broad international perspective and experience are valued.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (Australia, South Africa), civil law (Brazil, Romania), and mixed systems (Israel). This diversity indicates that familiarity with different legal traditions enhances a candidate's suitability, reflecting the international and multidisciplinary nature of the role.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., United Kingdom, United States, France) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Brazil, Romania). This suggests that the location of education is not a critical factor; what matters more is the quality of education and the relevance of the studies to human rights and health issues.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to health demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, and educational backgrounds. The selection process values diversity in legal traditions and educational experiences, reflecting the international and multidisciplinary requirements of the role. Multilingualism, particularly in English, and a strong background in human rights and health-related fields are key advantages.
