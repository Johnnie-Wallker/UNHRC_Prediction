1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, spanning from the mid-30s to the early 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity, as well as recent expertise and perspectives, are valued in candidates for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English, with many also possessing high proficiency in French and/or Arabic. This indicates that language skills in major international languages are crucial for effective communication and understanding across diverse cultural and regional contexts.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process is inclusive and considers candidates based on their qualifications and experience rather than gender.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse countries and regions, including the United Kingdom, United States, Switzerland, Yemen, Tunisia, Niger, Maldives, Senegal, and China. This diversity reflects the global nature of the mandate and the need for varied perspectives and experiences to address issues related to freedom of religion or belief.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal traditions of the candidates vary, with backgrounds in international human rights law, public law, and private law. This diversity in legal traditions suggests that a broad understanding of legal frameworks and human rights principles is valued, rather than a specific legal tradition.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of successful candidates is spread across various regions, including Europe, North America, and Asia. This indicates that the location of education, whether in OECD countries or global south, does not singularly determine success, but rather the quality and relevance of education to international human rights and legal frameworks.

In summary, the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief in the UNHRC reflects a preference for candidates with diverse backgrounds, strong language skills in major international languages, balanced gender representation, and a broad understanding of legal and human rights principles. The selection process values experience and global perspectives, irrespective of the specific legal tradition or the geographic location of education.
