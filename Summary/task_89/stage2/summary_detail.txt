1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 42 to 62 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, with candidates spanning two decades in age.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in major international languages. All candidates have high proficiency in English and French, and varying levels in Spanish. This indicates that multilingualism, particularly in widely spoken international languages, is a significant advantage.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates include both male and female representatives, with a slight predominance of male candidates. This suggests a slight gender imbalance, indicating that while both genders are considered, males might currently have a slight edge in selection.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates are from diverse Latin American and Caribbean countries, including Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. This diversity reflects the regional representation required by the mandate, indicating that candidates from these regions are well-represented and potentially favored.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal backgrounds are predominantly rooted in international and European legal traditions, as evidenced by their education in universities in Europe and Latin America. This suggests that familiarity with international legal frameworks and European legal traditions enhances a candidate's suitability for the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is notable, with candidates educated in both OECD countries (e.g., Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Brazil, Peru). This indicates that a broad educational exposure, encompassing both global north and south, is beneficial and possibly preferred in the selection process.

In summary, successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development within the UNHRC from Latin American and Caribbean States are typically older, multilingual, and educated in diverse international settings. They exhibit a strong background in international and European legal traditions and come from a range of countries within the region. While both genders are represented, there is a slight predominance of male candidates.
