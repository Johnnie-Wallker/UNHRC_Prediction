The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the early 50s to the early 70s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit or preference within this broad range.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all shortlisted candidates possess a high level of English proficiency. Additionally, some candidates also demonstrate proficiency in other major languages such as French, indicating that multilingualism is advantageous but not mandatory.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This indicates that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other, promoting gender diversity in the role.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Canada, and Thailand. This diversity suggests that geographical representation is considered important, with no single region or country dominating the selection.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal traditions vary, with backgrounds in common law (e.g., Australia, Canada, United Kingdom) and civil law (e.g., South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand). This indicates that candidates from different legal traditions are equally considered, emphasizing the importance of legal expertise and experience rather than a specific legal background.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the candidates is spread across various regions, including both OECD countries (e.g., Harvard, University of Oxford) and global south institutions (e.g., University of Witwatersrand, University of Colombo). This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the location of education is not a decisive factor, but rather the quality and relevance of the education received.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC values a broad range of ages, multilingual abilities, gender balance, and geographical diversity. Candidates from various legal traditions and educational backgrounds are considered, reflecting a comprehensive and inclusive approach to candidate selection.
