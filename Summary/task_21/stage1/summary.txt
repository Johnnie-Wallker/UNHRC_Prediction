These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates possess a mix of legal, academic, and practical experience. This includes backgrounds in law, academia, international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government sectors. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to human rights issues.

2. **Strong Linguistic Proficiency**: All shortlisted candidates demonstrate high proficiency in English, which is crucial for effective communication and report writing within the international arena of the UNHRC. Some candidates also exhibit proficiency in other languages, such as French, enhancing their ability to engage with a broader audience.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: The candidates currently hold positions that are directly related to law and human rights, either in academia, IGOs, NGOs, or government bodies. This indicates their active involvement and continuous engagement with human rights issues, providing them with up-to-date knowledge and skills.

4. **Age and Experience**: The age range of the successful candidates varies, but they generally fall within the 50 to 70 age bracket. This suggests that a balance of maturity and extensive experience is valued, ensuring candidates have the necessary insight and resilience to handle complex human rights situations.

5. **International Perspective**: Many candidates have international backgrounds or dual citizenship, reflecting their exposure to diverse cultural and legal systems. This international perspective is vital for addressing human rights issues in a global context, particularly in a role that requires cross-cultural understanding and diplomacy.
