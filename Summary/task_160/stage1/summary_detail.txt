1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from relatively young (around 40 years old) to quite experienced (over 70 years old). This suggests that age is not a limiting factor, and both younger and older candidates can be successful, reflecting a broad acceptance of diverse levels of experience.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, particularly English and French, which are common among the shortlisted candidates. Some candidates also demonstrate proficiency in additional languages such as Spanish and Arabic, indicating a preference for candidates with multilingual capabilities to effectively engage with a global audience.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This indicates that the selection process does not significantly favor one gender over the other, promoting gender equality in the selection for this mandate.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities and regions, including Africa, Europe, Asia, and North and South America. This diversity reflects the global nature of the mandate and the importance of having a broad geographical representation to address issues effectively on an international scale.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law, civil law, and international law, have been successful. This suggests that familiarity with multiple legal traditions is beneficial but not exclusively determinative, as the ability to navigate and integrate different legal frameworks is crucial for the mandate.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: Successful candidates have studied in a variety of locations, including both OECD countries and global south regions. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the selection process values exposure to different educational environments and perspectives, enhancing the ability to address global issues comprehensively.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the right to development in the UNHRC values a diverse range of experiences, language proficiencies, gender balance, and educational and legal backgrounds. The emphasis is on selecting candidates who can represent and address the needs of a global audience effectively, regardless of age, gender, nationality, or educational location.
