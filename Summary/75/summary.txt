1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates (fa7cdf, bd4c9a, 0777d5, 363663) range in age from 34 to 47, indicating a mix of younger and more experienced professionals.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates showing proficiency in English, French, and potentially other languages, suggesting that language skills are important but not necessarily a decisive factor.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates are all male, indicating a potential gender bias in the selection process. This could suggest that being male is an advantage in this context.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse African countries (Zimbabwe, Nigeria, South Africa), indicating that nationality is not a limiting factor. However, it does not appear that any specific nationality has a clear advantage.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in various legal traditions, including common law (King's College London, University of Witwatersrand) and civil law (McGill University, University of Cape Town). This suggests that familiarity with different legal traditions is beneficial but not decisive.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries (Canada, UK, USA) and the global south (South Africa, Nigeria). This indicates that the location of education, whether in an OECD country or the global south, does not necessarily make a candidate more likely to be successful. Instead, the diversity of educational experiences seems to be valued.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a mix of ages and language abilities, with no clear trend in these areas. Gender appears to be a factor, with all successful candidates being male. Nationality is diverse, and no single legal tradition or educational location seems to confer a clear advantage. Instead, a diverse educational background and familiarity with multiple legal traditions appear to be beneficial.
