1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide range of ages, from 40 to 64, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, all successful candidates possess high English proficiency, and most have high proficiency in at least one other language, suggesting that multilingual abilities are advantageous.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates are predominantly female, with only one male candidate (cd0069) among the shortlisted. This suggests a potential gender bias favoring female candidates in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Egypt, Croatia, Canada, Spain, Mexico, Greece, China, and Peru. This diversity indicates that no single nationality has a distinct advantage, but rather a broad international perspective is valued.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal traditions vary widely, with backgrounds in civil law, common law, and international law. This diversity suggests that familiarity with different legal traditions is beneficial, reflecting the international and multidisciplinary nature of the role.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have been educated in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This indicates that the geographical location of education is not a critical factor; what matters more is the quality and relevance of the education to international human rights and cultural rights.

In summary, the successful candidates are characterized by their multilingual abilities, diverse nationalities, and varied educational backgrounds that span different legal traditions and geographical locations. The predominance of female candidates suggests a gender bias in favor of women for this role.
