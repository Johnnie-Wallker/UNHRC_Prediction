1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 46 to 70 years old, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not confined to a specific age bracket.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, particularly English and either Arabic or French. This multilingual ability is crucial for addressing the global mandate of the Special Rapporteur.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process, which aligns with the UN's commitment to gender equality.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse regions, including the Middle East (Egypt, Lebanon), North America (United States), and Europe (United Kingdom, Switzerland/Sweden), are represented. This diversity underscores the global nature of the mandate and the need for a broad regional perspective.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong legal background, particularly in international law and human rights, are favored. This includes those educated and experienced in legal traditions ranging from civil law (e.g., Egypt, Switzerland) to common law (e.g., United States).

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates educated in both OECD countries (e.g., United States, Switzerland) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Egypt, Lebanon). This suggests that the quality of education, rather than its geographical location, is a key criterion.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment emphasizes a broad range of experience, multilingual capabilities, gender balance, and regional diversity, with a strong focus on candidates who have a robust legal and human rights background.
