The successful candidates for the position of Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and at least one other major international language such as Arabic, French, or Russian. This linguistic diversity is crucial for effectively communicating and engaging with a global audience and various stakeholders within the UN framework.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates possess a mix of professional experiences that include legal, academic, government, and non-governmental organization (NGO) backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of human rights issues from various perspectives and the ability to navigate complex international legal and political landscapes.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to law, human rights, or international governance. This indicates their active involvement and commitment to ongoing human rights advocacy and policy-making.

4. **Age and Experience**: While age varies among the candidates, the successful ones typically have a significant amount of professional experience, ranging from mid-career to senior levels. This experience is vital for handling the responsibilities of the Special Rapporteur position, which requires a deep understanding of international human rights mechanisms and practices.

5. **International Exposure**: Candidates with backgrounds in international governmental organizations (IGOs) and extensive work in international settings are preferred. This reflects the global nature of the mandate and the need for candidates who can effectively operate within and influence international human rights systems.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the importance of linguistic ability, professional diversity, current relevance, extensive experience, and international exposure in candidates for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC.
