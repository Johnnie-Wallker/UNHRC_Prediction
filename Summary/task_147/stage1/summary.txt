The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Legal Background**: All shortlisted candidates possess a strong legal background, which is crucial for understanding and addressing complex legal issues related to torture and human rights violations. This expertise enables them to navigate legal frameworks and advocate effectively for policy changes and legal protections.

2. **Multilingual Proficiency**: The candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and at least one other major language. This linguistic diversity is essential for communicating with a global audience and engaging with various stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and international organizations.

3. **Experience in Human Rights-Related Roles**: Successful candidates have extensive experience in human rights-related roles, whether through NGOs, international governmental organizations (IGOs), or government positions. This experience ensures they have practical knowledge of human rights advocacy, policy development, and the operational challenges in combating torture and other forms of abuse.

4. **Interdisciplinary Expertise**: Several candidates exhibit interdisciplinary expertise, combining legal knowledge with backgrounds in academia, government, or international relations. This interdisciplinary approach enhances their ability to analyze and address human rights issues from multiple perspectives.

5. **Current Engagement in Relevant Fields**: The shortlisted candidates are actively engaged in roles that are directly or indirectly related to human rights and law. This ongoing engagement ensures they remain current with emerging trends, challenges, and best practices in the field.

6. **Global Representation**: The candidates represent diverse geographical regions, which is vital for ensuring a broad and inclusive perspective on human rights issues. This diversity helps the Special Rapporteur to address regional specificities and build global consensus on anti-torture initiatives.

In summary, the selection of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur position emphasizes the importance of legal expertise, multilingual proficiency, human rights-related experience, interdisciplinary skills, active engagement in relevant fields, and global representation. These criteria provide a robust framework for identifying candidates who are well-equipped to fulfill the mandate effectively and advocate for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide.
