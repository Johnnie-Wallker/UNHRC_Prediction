Based on the information provided, the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 40 to 67 years old. This indicates that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential for fresh perspectives from younger candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of English proficiency, which is a common trend across international UN roles. French proficiency is less critical, and other languages like Spanish and Russian are not mandatory but can be advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be balanced.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates come from diverse regions, including the United States, Norway, and Hungary. This indicates that the selection process values a global perspective and does not favor candidates from any specific region or country.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, based on nationality and location of education, does not seem to be a decisive factor. Candidates with education and experience in various legal traditions, including those from civil law countries like France and common law countries like the United States, are successful.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: The diversity of the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and other regions. This suggests that the UNHRC values a broad educational background that includes exposure to different legal systems and cultural contexts.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC appears to prioritize candidates with a broad range of experiences, high proficiency in English, balanced gender representation, and diverse educational and professional backgrounds from various regions and legal traditions.
