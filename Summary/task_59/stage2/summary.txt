The successful candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, representing Western European and other States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, exhibit several key qualities that align with the mandate of promoting and protecting the rights of people of African descent. These qualities include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Candidates demonstrate a strong command of English and French, which are crucial for effective communication within the international arena of the UNHRC. Some candidates also exhibit basic or no proficiency in Spanish and Arabic, languages that are less commonly required but may still be beneficial in specific contexts.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates come from varied professional backgrounds, including legal, academic, NGO, government, and international governmental organizations (IGOs). This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to human rights issues.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently hold positions that are directly related to their backgrounds, such as law-related jobs or NGO-related roles. This indicates their active engagement and practical experience in human rights advocacy and legal frameworks.

4. **Age Diversity**: While the age of candidates varies, with some being in their 30s and others in their 40s, this diversity in age contributes to a range of perspectives and experiences, which is valuable in addressing complex human rights issues.

5. **Citizenship**: Candidates represent different countries, which reflects the international nature of the UNHRC and ensures a broad geographical representation in discussions and decisions related to people of African descent.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the importance of linguistic ability, professional diversity, active engagement in relevant fields, and a balance of age and geographical representation.
