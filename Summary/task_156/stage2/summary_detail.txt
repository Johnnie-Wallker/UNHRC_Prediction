The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) in the UNHRC, focusing on Eastern European States, reveals several trends and characteristics that could guide future candidate selection:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates exhibit a broad age range, from the early 40s to the late 50s. This suggests that a mix of seasoned professionals and those with substantial but not overly extended careers are favored, indicating a preference for candidates who are in their prime professional years and have accumulated significant experience.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English and Russian appears to be a significant advantage. Most candidates have demonstrated proficiency in English, with a notable number also being highly proficient in Russian. This suggests that language skills in major international and regional languages are crucial for effective communication and understanding of diverse legal contexts within the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced representation in terms of gender. This suggests that the selection process is equitable in terms of gender distribution, reflecting a commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse Eastern European countries have been successful, including those from countries like Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Serbia and Croatia, and Albania. This indicates that the selection process values regional representation and does not favor any particular nationality within the Eastern European region.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal background of candidates, particularly in areas related to human rights and international law, seems to be a significant factor. Candidates with experience in constitutional, criminal, and administrative law, as well as those who have worked on human rights issues at national and international levels, are well-represented. This suggests that familiarity with diverse legal traditions and a strong grounding in human rights law are advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: While specific details on the educational backgrounds of all candidates are not provided, the presence of candidates who have studied and worked in both Eastern European contexts and international settings (such as the UK) suggests that a diverse educational background, encompassing both regional and global perspectives, is valued. This diversity in educational exposure likely enhances the candidates' ability to navigate and contribute to international legal discussions and frameworks.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for the EMRTD in the UNHRC reflects a preference for experienced professionals with strong language skills, balanced gender representation, diverse regional backgrounds, and a solid grounding in human rights and international law. The educational backgrounds of candidates also appear to be diverse, encompassing both regional and international perspectives.
