1. **Strong Legal Background**: All successful candidates possess a robust legal background, which is crucial for understanding and addressing the complex legal implications of unilateral coercive measures and their impact on human rights.

2. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are the working languages of the UN. Some also have proficiency in Spanish and Russian, enhancing their ability to communicate and engage with a diverse range of stakeholders.

3. **Diverse Professional Experience**: Successful candidates have varied professional backgrounds that include experience in academia, international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government sectors. This diversity of experience equips them with a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand and the ability to navigate different institutional contexts.

4. **Relevant Current Job Role**: Many successful candidates are currently employed in roles that are directly related to law and academia, or involve work with IGOs and governments. This indicates their active engagement in fields relevant to the mandate and their capacity to contribute effectively to the role.

5. **International Perspective**: Candidates with dual or multiple citizenships, or those who have worked in various international settings, bring an international perspective to the role. This is essential for addressing the global nature of unilateral coercive measures and their human rights implications.
