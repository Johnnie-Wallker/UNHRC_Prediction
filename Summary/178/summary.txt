The successful candidates from the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, members from African States, are Candidate ID: d86ea6 (female, Benin, aged 64) and Candidate ID: dc82d6 (male, Zambia, aged 56). Here are the key features and trends observed among these successful candidates:

1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - **Age**: Both successful candidates are older, aged 64 and 56 respectively. This might suggest a trend where more experienced and possibly more senior candidates are favored.
   - **Language Abilities**: Both candidates have high levels of English and French, indicating a preference for candidates with strong multilingual capabilities, which are crucial for international diplomacy and communication within the UN framework.

2. **Gender**:
   - One candidate is female, and the other is male. This suggests that gender does not appear to be a decisive factor in the selection process, at least in this instance.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates are from Benin and Zambia. This does not necessarily indicate a trend favoring specific nationalities, as the sample size is small. However, it does show diversity in geographical representation from different parts of Africa.

4. **Legal Tradition and Education**:
   - **Legal Tradition**: Both candidates have extensive backgrounds in law and human rights, with significant experience in international human rights mechanisms. This suggests that a strong legal background and familiarity with international legal frameworks are crucial.
   - **Location of Education**: The education of these candidates spans both local and international institutions, including prestigious universities in Europe. This diversity in educational backgrounds might indicate a preference for candidates who have exposure to different legal systems and international perspectives.

5. **Diversity of Education Location**:
   - The diversity in the location of education, including both African and European institutions, suggests that candidates who have studied in various global contexts are seen as more likely to bring a broad and inclusive perspective to the role.

In summary, the successful candidates in this instance are characterized by their advanced age, strong multilingual skills, diverse educational backgrounds spanning both local and international institutions, and extensive experience in human rights and international law. Gender does not seem to be a decisive factor, and while there is diversity in nationality, the key factors appear to be related more to professional qualifications and experience.
