The shortlisted candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to education in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that may contribute to their success in this role:

1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - **Age**: The successful candidates range in age from 41 to 72, indicating that both younger and older candidates are considered. This suggests that experience and contemporary knowledge are both valued.
   - **Language Abilities**: All successful candidates have high English proficiency, and most also have high French proficiency. This multilingual ability is crucial for engaging with a global audience and understanding diverse cultural contexts.

2. **Gender**:
   - The shortlisted candidates include both men and women, suggesting that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including Italy, China, Belgium, Burkina Faso, and Greece. This diversity reflects the global mandate of the UNHRC and the need to represent various cultural and legal perspectives.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates' educational backgrounds and work experiences span various legal traditions, including civil law (e.g., Italy, Belgium), common law (e.g., United States), and international law. This diversity suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is valued.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries and the global south, reflecting a broad educational diversity. For example, Candidate ID 88a199 studied in Belgium, Norway, and China, while Candidate ID 0d4f48 studied in Greece, the UK, and the US. This diversity in educational locations indicates a preference for candidates who have been exposed to a variety of educational systems and cultural contexts.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur role demonstrate a balance between age, gender, and nationality diversity, as well as a broad range of language abilities and educational backgrounds. This suggests that the selection process values both experience and contemporary knowledge, multilingualism, and a deep understanding of diverse legal and cultural contexts.
