1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from the early 40s to the mid-60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit or preference.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, with most candidates demonstrating a high level of proficiency. Additionally, proficiency in French is also seen as advantageous, with several candidates having intermediate to high levels.
