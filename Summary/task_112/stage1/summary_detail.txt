1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea exhibit a wide age range, spanning from the mid-30s to the 70s. This suggests that extensive experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential for fresh perspectives and innovative approaches from younger candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English, with some also demonstrating fluency in other major languages such as French, Arabic, and Russian. This multilingual capability is crucial for effective communication and understanding of diverse cultural and legal contexts within the UN framework.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This reflects the UN's commitment to gender equality and the recognition that both genders can contribute effectively to human rights mandates.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities and regions, including Africa, Europe, South America, and the Middle East. This diversity underscores the importance of global representation and the understanding that regional expertise and perspectives are vital for addressing human rights issues in specific contexts like Eritrea.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong legal background, particularly in international law and human rights, are more likely to be successful. This includes those educated in both common law and civil law traditions, reflecting the need for a broad legal understanding to navigate complex international human rights issues.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This suggests that the quality of education, rather than its geographical location, is prioritized. However, international exposure through education in diverse settings is seen as beneficial for fostering a global perspective and understanding of varied legal systems and human rights challenges.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea values a wide age range, multilingual abilities, gender balance, diverse national and regional representation, a strong legal background encompassing various legal traditions, and a diverse educational experience that includes both local and international exposure.
