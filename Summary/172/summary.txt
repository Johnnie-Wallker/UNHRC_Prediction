1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates show a wide range of ages, from 41 to 68, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, all successful candidates have high English proficiency, suggesting that strong English language skills are crucial. Additionally, some candidates also possess proficiency in other languages, such as Spanish and Russian, which might be advantageous.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds including Australia, Russia, Greece, Kenya, Guatemala, and the United States/Ireland. This suggests that a variety of nationalities are considered favorably, and there is no clear advantage for candidates from any specific region.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (Australia, United States/Ireland) and civil law (Russia, Greece). This diversity indicates that the legal tradition is not a limiting factor; rather, a broad understanding and experience in different legal systems are valued.

5. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is spread across different types of countries, including both OECD countries (e.g., United States, United Kingdom, Germany) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Australia, Kenya). This suggests that the location of education, whether in the global north or south, does not necessarily determine success, but rather the relevance and depth of the education in human rights and indigenous rights issues.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples demonstrate a range of ages, genders, and nationalities, with strong English language skills being a common trait. Their educational backgrounds are diverse, spanning both OECD and non-OECD countries, and they come from various legal traditions. These factors collectively contribute to a well-rounded and globally informed perspective on indigenous rights, which is likely highly valued in this role.
