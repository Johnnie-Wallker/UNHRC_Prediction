The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates exhibit a broad age range, with ages spanning from the early 40s to the late 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit or preference.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in multiple major languages, with a strong emphasis on English and French. High proficiency in these languages is a common trait among the shortlisted candidates, indicating the importance of linguistic diversity and international communication for the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced proportion. This indicates that the selection process is not significantly biased towards one gender over the other, promoting gender equality in the selection criteria.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities and regions, including North America, Europe, and the Global South. This diversity reflects the international nature of the mandate and the need for a broad perspective on cultural rights.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition of the candidates varies, with some having a strong background in international law, human rights law, and comparative law. This suggests that a comprehensive understanding of legal frameworks and international human rights mechanisms is highly valued.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is diverse, with many having studied in both OECD countries and the Global South. This indicates that the selection committee values exposure to different educational environments and legal systems, which can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cultural rights issues.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC emphasizes a balance of experience, linguistic proficiency, gender equality, and international diversity. Candidates with a strong background in international and human rights law, who have studied in diverse educational settings, and who can communicate effectively in major international languages are more likely to be successful.
