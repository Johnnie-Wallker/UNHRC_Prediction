The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur position in the field of cultural rights at the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English and French, which are the two official working languages of the UN. Some candidates also possess additional language skills, particularly in Arabic and Spanish, which are beneficial given the global nature of cultural rights issues.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates have a mix of legal, academic, and international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of both legal frameworks and practical implementation strategies related to cultural rights. Some candidates also have experience in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government sectors, providing a broader perspective on cultural rights advocacy and policy-making.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Many successful candidates are currently engaged in academic or legal-related roles, which indicates their active involvement in research, teaching, or practical application of cultural rights. This experience is crucial for effectively fulfilling the duties of a Special Rapporteur, which often involve extensive research, reporting, and advocacy.

4. **Age and Experience**: The age range of the successful candidates (from mid-40s to mid-60s) suggests that a balance between seasoned experience and continued energy and innovation is valued. This combination is likely to contribute to a robust and dynamic approach to the role.

5. **Cultural and Geographical Representation**: The inclusion of candidates from various countries and regions ensures a global perspective on cultural rights. This geographical diversity is essential for addressing cultural rights issues that are often context-specific and require nuanced understanding.

In summary, the selection of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur position in cultural rights emphasizes multilingual proficiency, diverse professional backgrounds, relevant current employment, a balance of experience and innovation, and geographical representation. These criteria ensure that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address the complex and varied challenges associated with cultural rights on a global scale.
