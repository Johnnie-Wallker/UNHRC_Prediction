Based on the provided information, the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) can be summarized as follows:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 38 to 64 years old. This suggests that extensive experience and maturity are valued, but so is the energy and innovative thinking that younger candidates might bring.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, with most candidates having a high level in this language. Additionally, proficiency in French is also seen as beneficial, with some candidates demonstrating high levels in both English and French. This indicates a need for candidates who can communicate effectively in the major working languages of the UN.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be balanced, reflecting a commitment to gender equality in leadership roles.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse regions including Europe, Asia, and North America. This diversity in nationality suggests that a global perspective is valued, and there is no single region or country that holds a distinct advantage.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in international law and human rights are prevalent. This indicates that a strong legal foundation, particularly in international and human rights law, is crucial for success in this role. The legal tradition, often influenced by the location of education and professional practice, seems to play a significant role in the selection process.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from prestigious institutions around the world, including both OECD countries and global south, is represented among the successful candidates. This suggests that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued, and there is no specific advantage given to education from a particular type of region.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Special Rapporteur position emphasize a balance of experience, language proficiency, gender equality, and global representation, with a strong focus on candidates who have a robust legal background in international and human rights law. The diversity in educational experiences further underscores the importance of a broad and inclusive approach to candidate selection.
