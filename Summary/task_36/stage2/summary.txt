1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication within the international arena. Additionally, proficiency in French is highly valued, as it broadens the candidate's ability to engage with diverse stakeholders, particularly in Francophone regions.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a robust mix of legal, academic, and international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds are favored. This blend ensures a comprehensive understanding of legal frameworks, academic insights, and practical experience in international human rights mechanisms.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently employed in roles related to law, IGOs, or academia are considered advantageous. This indicates their active engagement in relevant fields and their ability to contribute effectively to the mandate.

4. **Geographical and Cultural Diversity**: Candidates from diverse geographical backgrounds, including those from both developing and developed countries, are preferred. This diversity enhances the ability of the Special Rapporteur to address human rights issues globally, considering varied cultural and legal contexts.

5. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, candidates with a significant amount of experience, typically reflected in their age, are seen as having accumulated the necessary knowledge and skills over time to handle the complexities of the mandate.
