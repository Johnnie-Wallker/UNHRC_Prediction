The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in the United Nations Human Rights Council reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide the selection process:

1. **Age Range**: The candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the late 40s to the early 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English and French appears to be a significant advantage, as all candidates possess high levels of proficiency in at least one of these languages. This indicates that multilingualism, particularly in widely spoken international languages, is crucial for effective communication and understanding across diverse global contexts.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This suggests that the UNHRC values diversity and inclusivity in terms of gender representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates hail from diverse regions including Africa, Asia, North America, and Europe. This diversity reflects the global mandate of the role and the importance of representing varied perspectives and experiences in addressing human rights issues worldwide.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates' legal traditions vary, with education and professional backgrounds spanning common law, civil law, and international law systems. This suggests that a broad understanding and experience across different legal traditions are beneficial, reflecting the need to navigate and integrate various legal frameworks in the execution of the mandate.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: Successful candidates have received education in both OECD countries and global south regions. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UNHRC values a broad educational foundation that includes exposure to different legal and cultural contexts, enhancing the candidate's ability to address complex human rights issues globally.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role emphasizes candidates who are experienced, multilingual, and representative of diverse legal and cultural backgrounds. The age range, language proficiency, gender balance, regional diversity, and educational diversity all contribute to selecting candidates who can effectively fulfill the mandate's requirements on a global scale.
