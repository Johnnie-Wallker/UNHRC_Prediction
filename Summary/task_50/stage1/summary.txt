The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the right to development in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit a combination of strong legal, academic, and international experience backgrounds. Key features that contributed to their selection include:

1. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates possess a blend of legal expertise, academic credentials, and experience in either governmental, intergovernmental, or non-governmental organizations. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to the multifaceted issues surrounding the right to development.

2. **International Exposure**: Candidates with backgrounds in intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) or significant international experience are favored. This reflects the global nature of the mandate and the need for the rapporteur to navigate and influence international dialogues effectively.

3. **Academic and Legal Synergy**: A strong presence of candidates who are currently engaged in academic roles, often combined with legal practice or policy-making, indicates a preference for those who can articulate complex issues clearly and advocate for policy changes based on scholarly research and legal frameworks.

4. **Language Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a baseline requirement, candidates with additional language skills, particularly French and Spanish, are advantageous due to the multilingual nature of the UN and the need to communicate effectively across different linguistic communities.

5. **Relevant Current Engagement**: Successful candidates are actively involved in roles that align with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, such as academic research, legal advocacy, and policy development within governmental or international settings. This suggests a focus on candidates who are currently contributing to or are closely aligned with the issues at hand.

These features collectively ensure that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address the complexities of the right to development, advocate for policy reforms, and engage effectively with diverse stakeholders within the international community.
