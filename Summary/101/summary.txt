1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, from 62 years (Candidate ID: 6832a7) to 43 years (Candidate ID: b44050), indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, all successful candidates possess high English proficiency, which is crucial for international roles within the UN. The diversity in language abilities among the successful candidates suggests that while English is essential, additional language skills are not mandatory.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both men and women (Candidate ID: 6832a7, b44050, 25db67 are women; Candidate ID: 14ea0d is a man), indicating no clear gender advantage in this selection.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities (Philippines, Sweden, United States, and Australia), suggesting that no single nationality has a distinct advantage. This diversity aligns with the UN's commitment to inclusivity and representation from various regions.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (United States), civil law (Philippines, Sweden), and potentially mixed systems. This diversity in legal traditions suggests that a candidate's legal background does not singularly determine success, but rather a comprehensive understanding and experience in international law and human rights is valued.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south (e.g., Philippines, Sweden, United States, and unspecified for Candidate ID: 14ea0d). This indicates that the geographical location of education is not a limiting factor; rather, the quality and relevance of education, particularly in areas related to human rights and international law, are more critical.

In summary, the successful candidates for the role of Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, and educational backgrounds. The selection emphasizes proficiency in English, relevant experience in human rights and international law, and a commitment to inclusivity and diversity.
