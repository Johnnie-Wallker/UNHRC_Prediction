Based on the provided information, the following key features of successful candidates for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, member from African States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, can be summarized:

1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the mid-40s to the early 50s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued attributes, but there is no strict age limit for selection.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English and French appears to be a significant requirement for the mandate, as all shortlisted candidates possess high levels of proficiency in these languages. This reflects the multilingual nature of the UN and the specific needs of the African region, where English and French are predominant.

3. **Gender Representation**: The information provided does not specify the gender of the candidates, making it impossible to assess any gender bias or preference in the selection process.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from diverse countries within the African region, including Benin, Togo, and Uganda, with some candidates holding dual citizenship. This indicates a preference for regional representation and a recognition of the importance of diverse national perspectives.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal backgrounds are predominantly rooted in international and public law, with significant experience in human rights law. This suggests that a strong grounding in international legal frameworks and human rights is advantageous for the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates have received education in various locations, including universities in Europe and Africa. This diversity in educational settings indicates that a global or mixed educational background is not necessarily a prerequisite, but a strong academic foundation in relevant fields is highly valued.

In summary, the selection process for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention seems to prioritize candidates with a robust background in international and human rights law, fluency in major international languages (English and French), and a broad representation of nationalities from the African region. Age appears to be a secondary factor, with a preference for candidates who have gained substantial experience and maturity. The specific gender distribution cannot be assessed from the provided data, and the location of education is seen as valuable but not determinative of success.
