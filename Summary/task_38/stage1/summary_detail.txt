This diversity underscores the importance of regional representation and the recognition that expertise in human rights and education can be found globally.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal traditions vary, with backgrounds in civil law, common law, and international law. This suggests that a broad legal background is beneficial, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of human rights work and the need to navigate different legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is spread across various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UNHRC values exposure to different educational systems and cultural contexts, which is essential for a role that requires a global perspective.
