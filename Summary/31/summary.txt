1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates range in age from 36 to 45, indicating a preference for candidates who are experienced but not necessarily very senior. All candidates have a high level of English proficiency, which is crucial for international roles within the UNHRC. Two of the candidates have low proficiency in another language (Russian or French), suggesting that while multilingualism is beneficial, it is not a decisive factor if English is strong.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include two women and one man, indicating no clear gender bias in the selection process. This suggests that the selection committee values diverse perspectives and does not favor one gender over the other.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent diverse Eastern European nationalities (Poland, Albania, Slovakia), indicating that there is no clear advantage for candidates from any specific country within the region. This diversity in nationality suggests a commitment to regional representation and balance.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates have studied and worked in various legal traditions, including international law, human rights law, and medical law. This diversity in legal backgrounds suggests that the committee values a broad understanding of legal issues related to enforced or involuntary disappearances, rather than favoring candidates from a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including Eastern Europe, the United States, and Western Europe (e.g., Harvard Law School, Kent Law School, Fordham University School of Law). This indicates that the committee values international exposure and the ability to understand and navigate different legal systems and cultures. The inclusion of candidates who have studied in both OECD countries and other regions suggests a preference for candidates with a broad educational background.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances demonstrate a range of ages, strong English proficiency, balanced gender representation, diverse nationalities, varied legal traditions, and international educational experiences. These factors collectively contribute to their suitability for the role within the UNHRC.
