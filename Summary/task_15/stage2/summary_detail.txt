1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from the late 30s to the early 80s, indicating that experience and maturity are valued but not exclusive criteria. This diversity suggests that the selection process does not rigidly favor a specific age group, but rather considers a broad spectrum of professional experiences.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all candidates possess a high level in this language. Some candidates also demonstrate proficiency in French and Spanish, which are beneficial given the multilingual nature of the United Nations. This suggests that while English is essential, additional language skills can be advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This balance reflects a commitment to inclusivity and diversity in leadership roles within the UNHRC.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates hail from diverse regions including South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. This diversity underscores the importance of global representation and the absence of a regional bias in the selection process. Each region contributes valuable perspectives, aligning with the UN's commitment to international cooperation and understanding.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in common law and civil law traditions are represented, suggesting that the legal tradition does not predetermine success. Instead, the focus seems to be on the application of human rights principles and practical experience in international human rights law.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from both OECD countries and global south institutions is represented among the candidates. This indicates that the selection process values educational diversity and recognizes the quality of education across different regions, reinforcing the UNHRC's commitment to inclusivity and global perspectives.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health in the UNHRC emphasizes a broad range of experiences, language proficiency, gender balance, regional diversity, and educational background. This approach ensures that the chosen candidates can effectively represent and advocate for global health rights within the international community.
