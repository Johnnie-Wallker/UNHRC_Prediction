The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Legal Background**: A strong legal background is consistently noted among successful candidates. This suggests that a deep understanding of human rights law and international legal frameworks is crucial for effectively addressing and reporting on human rights issues in Eritrea.

2. **International Experience**: Candidates with backgrounds in International Governmental Organizations (IGOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are frequently shortlisted. This indicates the importance of having experience in international human rights advocacy and policy-making.

3. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, is a significant advantage. This proficiency enhances the candidate's ability to communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders and to navigate the multilingual environment of the UNHRC.

4. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates often have a mix of academic, governmental, and organizational backgrounds. This diversity allows for a comprehensive approach to human rights issues, drawing on various perspectives and experiences.

5. **Relevant Current Role**: Candidates currently engaged in roles related to law, IGOs, NGOs, or government positions are favored. This relevance ensures that the candidate is actively involved in human rights work and is up-to-date with current challenges and developments.

6. **Geographical Representation**: While not explicitly stated, the selection of candidates from various regions (e.g., Europe, Africa, North America) suggests a preference for geographical diversity to ensure a global perspective on human rights issues.

In summary, the ideal candidate for the Special Rapporteur position should possess a robust legal background, extensive international experience, multilingual skills, diverse professional expertise, and be currently engaged in relevant human rights work. These criteria ensure that the candidate is well-equipped to address the complex human rights situation in Eritrea and to effectively represent the interests of the UNHRC.
