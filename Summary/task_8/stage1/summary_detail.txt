The summary of the key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to fall within an experienced age range, typically between 40 to 73 years old. This suggests that a certain level of professional maturity and experience is valued for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is consistently required, with many candidates also possessing proficiency in French and/or Arabic, reflecting the linguistic diversity of the regions involved in human rights issues. This indicates that multilingual capabilities are advantageous, particularly in languages relevant to international diplomacy and human rights discourse.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. However, the specific proportions of each gender among the shortlisted candidates are not detailed, which could be important for assessing any subtle biases.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates hail from diverse regions, including Europe, Africa, and the Americas. This suggests that geographical diversity is valued, reflecting the global nature of human rights issues and the need for a broad perspective. Countries from these regions are well-represented, indicating no single region or country has a monopoly on successful candidates.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a background in common law and civil law traditions have been successful, indicating that familiarity with diverse legal systems is beneficial. This is likely due to the international and often cross-jurisdictional nature of human rights work.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from both OECD countries and global south institutions is represented among the successful candidates. This suggests that the diversity of educational backgrounds, reflecting a mix of global and regional perspectives, is considered advantageous.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for the Special Rapporteur position in the UNHRC appears to favor those with a mature professional background, multilingual abilities, and a diverse educational and legal background. The selection also emphasizes geographical diversity and a balanced representation of genders. These factors collectively contribute to the selection of candidates who are well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted nature of human rights issues in Eritrea.
