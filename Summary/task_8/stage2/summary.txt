The successful candidates for the position of Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Legal and Multidisciplinary Background**: Successful candidates typically possess a strong legal background, which is essential for addressing and reporting on human rights issues. Additionally, many candidates have a multidisciplinary background, including experience in academia, international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government sectors. This diverse experience equips them with a comprehensive understanding of human rights issues from various perspectives.

2. **Language Proficiency**: Candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are widely used in international diplomacy and human rights reporting. Some candidates also have proficiency in Arabic, reflecting the linguistic context of the region. This linguistic diversity is crucial for effective communication and understanding of regional dynamics.

3. **International Experience**: Successful candidates often have extensive experience working in international contexts, such as IGOs and NGOs. This experience is vital for navigating the complexities of international human rights law and diplomacy, and for building networks and partnerships necessary for effective advocacy and reporting.

4. **Relevant Current Job**: Candidates currently engaged in roles related to law, IGOs, NGOs, or academia are favored. These positions reflect active involvement in human rights issues and demonstrate a commitment to ongoing engagement in the field.

5. **Geographical and Cultural Relevance**: While not a strict criterion, candidates with backgrounds from countries in the region or with significant experience in similar contexts are advantageous. This relevance helps in understanding the local dynamics and challenges specific to Eritrea.

In summary, the ideal candidate for the Special Rapporteur position should have a robust legal background, diverse international experience, proficiency in key international languages, and a current role that aligns with human rights advocacy and reporting. These features ensure that the candidate is well-equipped to fulfill the mandate effectively and contribute to the advancement of human rights in Eritrea.
