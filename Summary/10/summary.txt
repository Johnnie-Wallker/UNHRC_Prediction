1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates show a mix in age, ranging from 38 to 66 years, indicating that both younger and older professionals are valued.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates displaying varying levels of English, French, and Spanish. High proficiency in English and Spanish seems beneficial, as most candidates have at least one of these languages at a high level.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, suggesting that gender is not a decisive factor in selection.

3. **Nationality**:
   - Candidates from diverse Latin American countries were successful, including Peru, Bolivia, Saint Lucia, and Brazil. This indicates that there is no single nationality that holds an advantage, but rather a broad representation from the region is preferred.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including civil law (e.g., Spain, France) and common law (e.g., United States). This suggests that a diverse legal background is valued, reflecting the need to understand and address the complex legal frameworks affecting indigenous peoples across different jurisdictions.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The education of successful candidates was obtained in both OECD countries (e.g., United States, Spain) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Peru, Bolivia). This indicates that the location of education is not a limiting factor; what matters more is the relevance and depth of the education to human rights and indigenous issues.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) demonstrate a diversity in age, language abilities, gender, and nationality. A strong background in legal studies, particularly those related to human rights and indigenous issues, is crucial. The location of education does not seem to be a barrier if the education is relevant and comprehensive.
