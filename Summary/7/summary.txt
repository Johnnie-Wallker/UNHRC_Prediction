1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates show a mix in age, ranging from 51 to 72 years, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, language abilities seem to play a role, with candidates possessing multiple high-level language skills, particularly English, French, and Russian, which are relevant for international diplomacy and human rights advocacy.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female applicants (IDs bdb106, a34bac, eddb90, and 27ed0f), suggesting that gender does not confer a distinct advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities (France, Romania, and the United Kingdom), indicating that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage. This diversity reflects the UN's commitment to inclusivity and varied perspectives.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The legal backgrounds of the candidates vary, with some having legal educations (e.g., law degrees, human rights studies) and others focusing on political science, international relations, or engineering. This suggests that a broad range of educational and professional backgrounds is valued, rather than a specific legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education**: The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including both OECD countries (e.g., France, UK, Romania) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Eritrea). This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the UN values a broad educational foundation, irrespective of the geographical location of the educational institution.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus demonstrate a diversity in age, gender, nationality, educational backgrounds, and language abilities. The selection process appears to prioritize candidates with a strong background in human rights, international relations, and diplomacy, supported by a robust professional experience in relevant fields. The diversity in educational and professional experiences suggests that the UN seeks a balanced and inclusive approach to addressing human rights issues.
