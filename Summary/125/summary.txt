1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 47 to 61, indicating a preference for candidates with significant experience and maturity.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with high proficiency in English being common, and varying levels of proficiency in other languages such as French, Spanish, and Arabic. This suggests that while multilingualism is valued, high English proficiency is particularly important.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating no clear gender advantage. This balance suggests that the selection process values diversity in gender representation.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates represent a range of nationalities, including Pakistan, Spain, Estonia, Sweden, Germany, and Argentina. This diversity in nationality indicates that the selection process values a broad international perspective and does not favor any particular nationality.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including civil law (Spain, Argentina) and common law (Pakistan, Germany). This suggests that the selection process values a mix of legal traditions and does not exclusively favor candidates from any single legal tradition.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and the global south. For example, candidates have studied in the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Argentina. This indicates that the selection process values educational diversity and does not necessarily favor candidates who have studied exclusively in OECD countries.

In summary, the successful candidates demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, legal traditions, and educational backgrounds. The selection process appears to value diversity and experience, with no single factor conferring a clear advantage.
