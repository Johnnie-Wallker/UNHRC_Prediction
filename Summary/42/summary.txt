1. **Age and Language Abilities**: The successful candidates (4e732c, 34173c, 02e74f, 8e296a) span a range of ages, from 50 to 57, indicating that age is not a decisive factor. However, all successful candidates possess high English proficiency, and most have additional language skills (French, Spanish, Arabic), suggesting that multilingual abilities are advantageous.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both male and female candidates (2 females: 4e732c, 8e296a; 2 males: 34173c, 02e74f), indicating that gender does not confer a distinct advantage in this selection.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates represent diverse nationalities (Colombia, Canada, Honduras, and Canada again), suggesting that no single nationality has a clear advantage. This diversity in nationality may reflect the UN's commitment to inclusivity and representation from various regions.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in international law, human rights, and humanitarian issues, which are directly relevant to the role of Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons. This suggests that candidates with a legal background, particularly in international and human rights law, are more likely to be successful.

5. **Location of Education**: The education of the successful candidates is spread across various locations, including Colombia, Canada, and France, with some having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational locations indicates that a broad educational background, encompassing different legal and cultural traditions, is beneficial. It suggests that the UN values candidates who have been exposed to a variety of educational and cultural environments, which can enhance their understanding and approach to global issues.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a strong background in international law and human rights, possess high language proficiency, and have a diverse educational background across different countries and legal traditions. Age and gender do not appear to be decisive factors, and the selection reflects a broad representation of nationalities.
