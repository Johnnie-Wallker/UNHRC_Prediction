The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) from Central and South America and the Caribbean, as shortlisted in the UNHRC meetings, exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a strong command of Spanish, which is crucial given the predominantly Spanish-speaking regions of Central and South America. Additionally, some candidates have varying levels of proficiency in English and French, which enhances their ability to engage with a broader international community.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The shortlisted candidates possess a mix of legal, academic, NGO, government, and IGO backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and representation of various aspects related to indigenous rights, including legal frameworks, academic research, and practical implementation through NGOs and government bodies.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Most successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly or indirectly related to indigenous rights. This includes positions in academia, NGOs, and government, reflecting their active involvement and commitment to the field.

4. **Age and Experience**: While age information is not available for all candidates, those with known ages show a range of experience levels, from mid-career to more seasoned professionals. This balance ensures a mix of fresh perspectives and deep institutional knowledge.

5. **Geographic Representation**: The shortlisted candidates come from diverse countries within the region, ensuring a broad geographical representation that reflects the varied contexts and challenges faced by indigenous peoples across Central and South America and the Caribbean.

These key features underscore the importance of language skills, professional diversity, active engagement in relevant fields, and geographic representation in selecting candidates for the EMRIP at the UNHRC. This approach ensures that the selected experts can effectively contribute to the protection and promotion of indigenous rights within the region and globally.
