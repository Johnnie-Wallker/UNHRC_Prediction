The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Trend**: The age range of the shortlisted candidates is not explicitly uniform, as one candidate's age is provided (63 years), while others are unknown. However, the presence of a seasoned candidate suggests that experience and maturity might be valued, though this is not definitive due to the lack of age data for other candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English and Spanish, as all shortlisted candidates possess high levels of proficiency in these languages. This indicates that fluency in these major languages is crucial for the mandate, likely due to the international and regional scope of the role.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with no clear gender dominance in the selection. This suggests that the selection process aims for gender parity or at least does not favor one gender over the other based on the provided data.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: The successful candidates hail from diverse countries including Nicaragua, Bolivia, Mexico, and Chile. This indicates that candidates from Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean, are well-represented, suggesting that familiarity with the regional context and issues related to indigenous peoples in these areas is beneficial.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with strong legal backgrounds and experience in indigenous rights, particularly those educated in diverse legal traditions and jurisdictions, seem to have an advantage. This includes those with degrees from universities in different countries and those with expertise in international law and indigenous rights.

6. **Location and Diversity of Education**: Candidates who have pursued education in various locations, including both OECD countries and the global south, appear to be more likely to succeed. This diversity in educational exposure may reflect a broader understanding of international and regional issues pertinent to indigenous rights.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for EMRIP in the UNHRC seems to favor those with extensive legal and policy expertise in indigenous rights, fluency in major international languages (English and Spanish), and a broad educational background that spans different regions and legal traditions. Additionally, the selection process appears to strive for a balanced representation of gender and regional diversity.
