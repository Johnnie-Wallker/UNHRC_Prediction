1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 41 to 64 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age requirement, indicating a preference for candidates who have had substantial time to develop expertise in indigenous rights.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, as it is a common requirement across all candidates. Fluency in other major languages, such as Russian and French, is also seen, but less consistently. This indicates that multilingualism is beneficial, especially in languages relevant to the Arctic region and international diplomacy.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with no clear gender bias observed in the selection. This suggests that the selection process is striving for gender equality, although the exact proportions would need to be analyzed to confirm this.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from the United States, Norway, and Russia are represented among the shortlisted candidates. This diversity reflects the importance of regional representation from countries within the Arctic circle, suggesting that familiarity with the local context and international relations specific to the Arctic region is highly valued.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in law, particularly international law and indigenous rights, are more likely to be successful. This includes those educated in various legal traditions, indicating that a broad understanding of legal frameworks is beneficial.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from diverse locations, including both OECD countries and other regions, is seen among the successful candidates. This suggests that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued, emphasizing the importance of global perspectives and understanding in addressing indigenous rights issues.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the Arctic seem to prioritize candidates with a broad legal background, particularly in international and indigenous rights, who are multilingual, and who represent a range of Arctic nations. Age diversity and gender balance are also considerations in the selection process.
