Additionally, they maintain a proficient level in Spanish, reflecting their regional linguistic capabilities.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates possess a mix of backgrounds that include legal expertise, academic credentials, and experience with international governmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government sectors. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of human rights issues related to transnational corporations.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: The candidates currently hold positions that are directly related to law and academia or within the NGO sector. This relevance underscores their active engagement and contribution to the field of human rights, particularly in contexts that intersect with business operations.

4. **Age and Experience**: The candidates range in age, suggesting a balance between seasoned professionals and those with a mature but still evolving career trajectory. This mix is beneficial for bringing a range of perspectives and innovative approaches to the Working Group.

5. **Dual Citizenship (if applicable)**: In cases where candidates hold citizenship in multiple Latin American and Caribbean countries, this dual citizenship can enhance their ability to represent a broader regional perspective and foster cooperation among different states within the region.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, emphasizing the importance of linguistic proficiency, diverse and relevant professional backgrounds, active engagement in the field, and a balanced representation of experience and regional perspectives.
