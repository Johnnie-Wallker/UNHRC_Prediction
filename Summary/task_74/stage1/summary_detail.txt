The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide the selection process:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from the late 30s to the mid-70s. This suggests that extensive experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential for fresh perspectives from younger candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is a common trend across all shortlisted candidates. Additionally, fluency in other major languages such as French, Arabic, and Spanish is seen in some candidates, indicating that multilingualism is advantageous but not mandatory.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process is not overtly biased towards one gender over the other.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Sudan, Turkey, Belgium, Pakistan, and Hungary. This diversity indicates that the selection is not regionally biased, although it is notable that none of the shortlisted candidates are from Iran, the country directly related to the mandate.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition of the candidates varies, with some having a strong background in international law and human rights, while others have a more general legal or sociological background. This suggests that a deep understanding of international human rights law is beneficial, but not exclusively determinant.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of the candidates is spread across various regions, including Europe, North America, and the Middle East. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the location of education, whether in OECD countries or global south, does not singularly determine success. However, education from prestigious institutions and programs in international law and human rights appears to be a significant factor.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur position seems to value a combination of extensive experience, language proficiency, gender balance, and regional diversity, while also considering the depth of understanding in international human rights law and the prestige of educational institutions.
