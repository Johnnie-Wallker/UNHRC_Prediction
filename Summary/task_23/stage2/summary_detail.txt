Based on the provided information, the following key features of successful candidates for the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism in the United Nations Human Rights Council can be summarized:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates appear to fall within a relatively narrow age range, predominantly between 32 and 43 years old. This suggests a preference for candidates who are likely to have a blend of experience and energy to undertake the demanding role of an Independent Expert.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all candidates have a high level of proficiency in this language. Additionally, some candidates also possess proficiency in other major languages such as Arabic, French, and Spanish, indicating that multilingualism is valued, especially in languages relevant to the regions where albinism is most prevalent.

3. **Gender Balance**: The presence of both male and female candidates among the shortlisted individuals suggests that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates appears to be balanced, reflecting a commitment to gender equality in the selection criteria.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse regions, including Africa, New Zealand, Egypt, and the United Kingdom. This diversity underscores the importance of regional representation and the understanding of local contexts, which is crucial for addressing the specific challenges faced by persons with albinism in different parts of the world.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While some candidates have backgrounds in law, others come from social sciences and anthropology. This suggests that the role values a broad understanding of human rights and social issues, rather than exclusively legal expertise. However, legal training can be advantageous, particularly in areas such as international law and policy analysis.

6. **Location of Education**: The education of candidates spans various regions, including both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the selection committee values exposure to different educational systems and perspectives, which can enhance the candidate's ability to address global issues from multiple angles.

In summary, the selection process for the Independent Expert role appears to favor candidates within a specific age range, with strong language skills, balanced gender representation, and diverse regional and educational backgrounds. The role values a blend of legal and social science expertise, and the location of education is considered beneficial if it provides a broad and diverse perspective on human rights issues.
