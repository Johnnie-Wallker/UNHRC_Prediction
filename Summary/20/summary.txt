1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates' ages range from 41 to 73, indicating a broad age spectrum, which suggests that age is not a decisive factor.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates exhibiting proficiency in multiple languages, including English, French, Russian, Arabic, and Spanish. This diversity in language skills is likely advantageous, given the international nature of the role.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, suggesting that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates represent a wide range of nationalities, including Belarus, India, Malaysia, Spain, Greece, Switzerland/USA/Cuba, UK/Italy, Argentina/Italy, and France. This diversity in nationality indicates that there is no single nationality that holds an advantage.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates' educational backgrounds and work experiences span various legal traditions, including common law (e.g., UK, USA), civil law (e.g., France, Spain), and mixed systems (e.g., Switzerland). This suggests that familiarity with diverse legal traditions is beneficial but not exclusively decisive.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in various locations, including OECD countries (e.g., USA, UK, Netherlands, France) and non-OECD countries (e.g., India, Belarus). This diversity in educational locations indicates that both OECD and non-OECD educational backgrounds are valued, reflecting the need for a global perspective.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, language proficiencies, genders, nationalities, legal traditions, and educational backgrounds. This diversity suggests that the selection process values a broad spectrum of experiences and perspectives, with no single factor conferring a clear advantage.
