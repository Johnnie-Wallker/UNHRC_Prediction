The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Working Group on human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, member from African States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, provides several insights into the selection criteria:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, suggesting that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively so. The ages range from the mid-30s to the late 40s, indicating a preference for candidates who are likely to have accumulated substantial professional experience while still being energetic and adaptable.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all shortlisted candidates have a high level of proficiency in this language. Additionally, some candidates also possess proficiency in French and other languages, which may be advantageous given the multilingual nature of the UN and the African context.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates are all male, which indicates a potential gender imbalance in the selection process. This suggests that, at least for this particular selection, there may be a bias towards male candidates, or that fewer female candidates applied or were considered for the shortlist.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse African countries, including Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia. This diversity reflects the regional representation needed for a group dealing with issues affecting the African continent, suggesting that a broad geographic spread is valued.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal backgrounds vary, with education from universities in different countries, including both African and international institutions. This diversity in legal education suggests that a broad understanding of various legal traditions is beneficial, rather than a specific legal background.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates have studied in various locations, including both within Africa and internationally (e.g., Europe and North America). This indicates that a global educational background is not mandatory, but exposure to diverse educational environments is likely seen as advantageous for understanding and addressing complex international human rights issues.

In conclusion, the selection process for this mandate seems to value a broad range of experiences, including diverse educational backgrounds and a mix of nationalities, while also highlighting the importance of language proficiency, particularly in English. However, the lack of female representation among the shortlisted candidates is a notable concern that may need to be addressed in future selections to ensure gender balance and inclusivity.
