1. **Age or Language Abilities**: Among the successful candidates, there is no clear trend regarding age since the ages are unknown for most. However, language abilities seem to be a significant factor, with all successful candidates having a high level of Spanish and at least one other language (English or French). This suggests that multilingualism, particularly in English and Spanish, is advantageous.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating that gender does not appear to be a determining factor in the selection process. Both genders are represented among the shortlisted candidates.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Nicaragua, Bolivia, Mexico, and Chile. This suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, but rather a broad representation from Central and South America and the Caribbean is preferred.

4. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have a strong background in law, particularly in areas related to indigenous rights and human rights. This includes degrees from various legal traditions, such as civil law and common law, and experience in international law. The legal tradition, particularly if it involves international or comparative law, seems to be beneficial.

5. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident among the successful candidates, with education obtained both in OECD countries (e.g., The University of Arizona, New York University) and in the global south (e.g., Universidad Centroamericana, Universidad Mayor de San Andr¨¦s). This suggests that the location of education, whether in an OECD country or in the global south, does not necessarily determine success, but rather the relevance and quality of the education in areas pertinent to indigenous rights and international cooperation.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a strong background in law and indigenous rights, multilingualism, and a diverse educational background that includes both OECD countries and the global south. There is no clear advantage based on gender or nationality, but rather a preference for candidates with relevant expertise and international exposure.
