1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a broad age range, with the majority falling between the ages of 40 to 56. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English and often in French as well. This dual proficiency in English and French is a common trait among the shortlisted candidates, reflecting the multilingual nature of the United Nations and the need for effective communication across different regions.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with an equal number of male and female candidates shortlisted. This indicates that the selection is not biased towards a particular gender and that both genders are equally considered for this mandate.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Western European countries, North America, and other regions. This diversity in nationality suggests that a broad geographical representation is valued, ensuring a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, as indicated by the candidates' nationalities and educational backgrounds, does not seem to be a decisive factor. Candidates from various legal traditions, including common law and civil law, are represented among the shortlisted candidates. This indicates a preference for a diverse legal background that can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of international human rights issues.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity of the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and other regions. This suggests that the selection committee values exposure to different educational environments and legal systems, which can enhance the candidates' ability to address global human rights challenges.

In summary, the selection process for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in the UNHRC emphasizes a broad age range, multilingual proficiency, gender balance, geographical diversity, and a mix of legal traditions and educational backgrounds. These criteria ensure a well-rounded and capable group of candidates to address the complex issues of arbitrary detention.
