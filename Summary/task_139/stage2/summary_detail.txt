1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a diverse age range, with individuals aged from 40 to 56. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English and French appears to be a significant advantage, as all candidates possess high levels in these languages. Spanish is also beneficial, though not uniformly required, with varying proficiency levels among the candidates.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process seems balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This indicates a fair representation of both genders, reflecting a commitment to gender equality in the selection.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from Western European countries, including France, Ireland, Greece, and Canada, are well-represented. This suggests a preference for candidates from these regions, possibly due to their established human rights frameworks and legal systems.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a background in common law (e.g., from the UK, Canada, and Ireland) and civil law (e.g., from France) are both represented. This diversity indicates that a broad legal tradition is valued, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of various legal systems.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates educated in both OECD countries (e.g., Oxford, McGill, Yale) and non-OECD countries (e.g., University of Lille, University of the West of England). This suggests that a global educational background is beneficial, reflecting a broadened perspective and understanding of international human rights law.

In summary, successful candidates for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in the UNHRC typically exhibit a range of ages, strong language skills in English and French, balanced gender representation, and a diverse legal and educational background. Nationality from Western European countries appears to be advantageous, but a global educational perspective is highly valued.
