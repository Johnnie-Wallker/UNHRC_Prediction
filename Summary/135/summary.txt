1. **Age and Language Abilities**: Among the successful candidates (24146d, 883e88, e515df), there is a mix in age with one candidate being 44 years old (24146d) and another being 50 years old (883e88), while the age of the third candidate (e515df) is unknown. All candidates have high English language abilities, indicating that proficiency in English is a significant factor.

2. **Gender**: The successful candidates are all female (24146d, 883e88, e515df), suggesting a potential advantage for female candidates in this context. This could reflect a preference or a trend towards gender diversity in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**: The successful candidates are from Australia (24146d, 883e88) and Samoa (e515df). This could indicate a slight advantage for candidates from these countries, possibly due to their familiarity with the Pacific region or their representation of key Pacific nations in the UNHRC.

4. **Legal Tradition and Education**: The successful candidates have strong backgrounds in law, with degrees from prominent universities in Australia and potentially other locations for the Samoan candidate (e515df, whose educational background is not detailed). This suggests that a strong legal education, particularly in international law, is advantageous. The Australian candidates have studied and worked extensively in Australia, which follows a common law tradition, indicating a possible preference for candidates with a common law background.

5. **Location of Education**: The Australian candidates (24146d, 883e88) have studied at Australian National University and the University of Queensland, both in common law jurisdictions. This might suggest a slight advantage for candidates educated in established, English-speaking, and possibly OECD countries, reflecting a trend towards recognizing educational credentials from these regions. However, the lack of detailed information on the Samoan candidate's education (e515df) prevents a definitive conclusion on the diversity of educational locations.

In summary, the successful candidates in this selection process exhibit a mix of attributes including high English proficiency, a strong legal background, and a predominance of female candidates. Nationality and the location of education, particularly within established legal and educational systems, also seem to play a role in the selection.
