1. **Age Trend**: The age information for the candidates varied, with one candidate's age being specified (56 years old) and the others unknown. This suggests that while age might not be a strict criterion, experience and maturity, as indicated by a more advanced age in one case, could be beneficial.

2. **Language Abilities**: All candidates demonstrated high proficiency in English and Russian, with no proficiency in Spanish. This indicates that fluency in English and Russian is a significant requirement for the mandate, likely due to the international and regional contexts of the role within the UNHRC.

3. **Gender Balance**: The candidates included both male and female representatives, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the shortlisted candidates appears balanced, aligning with the UN's commitment to gender equality.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: All candidates are from Russia, indicating a strong representation from this country. This could suggest a regional focus or preference for candidates from countries with significant indigenous populations or active indigenous rights movements.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' backgrounds in law, particularly civil and financial law, and their roles in legal assessments and legislative initiatives, suggest that a legal background is advantageous. This is crucial for navigating and influencing legal frameworks and international standards related to indigenous rights.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in educational locations was not explicitly noted, with all educational institutions being within Russia. This might suggest that local knowledge and expertise within the region are highly valued. However, the absence of education from international or OECD countries could also indicate a potential area for broadening the criteria to include global perspectives.

In summary, successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) within the UNHRC from Central and Eastern Europe, the Russian Federation, Central Asia, and Transcaucasia typically exhibit high proficiency in English and Russian, have a balanced representation of genders, and often come from a legal background with strong regional ties and expertise in indigenous rights.
