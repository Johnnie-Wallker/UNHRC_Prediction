The successful candidates for the role of Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali at the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key qualities that align with the mandate's requirements. These qualities include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English and French, which are crucial for effective communication within the international community, particularly in a context like Mali where French is widely spoken. Proficiency in Arabic may also be advantageous given the regional context.

2. **Relevant Backgrounds**: Candidates with a mix of legal, NGO, and possibly international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds are favored. This combination ensures a comprehensive understanding of human rights frameworks, practical experience in advocacy and implementation, and familiarity with international diplomacy and policy-making.

3. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, a balance of experience and energy is beneficial. Candidates in their 40s to 60s, who have accumulated substantial experience across various sectors, are typically well-suited to handle the complexities of the role.

4. **Current Relevance**: Candidates currently engaged in NGO or government-related work are considered more relevant, as they are likely to be actively involved in contemporary human rights issues and possess up-to-date knowledge and skills.

5. **Cultural and Regional Relevance**: Candidates from countries within or closely related to the African region, particularly those with Francophone backgrounds, are advantageous due to their potential understanding of the cultural, political, and social dynamics in Mali and the broader Sahel region.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, ensuring that candidates not only meet the technical requirements but also possess the practical skills and contextual understanding necessary for effectively addressing human rights issues in Mali.
