The summary of the key features of the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) provides a clear guideline for the candidate selection process. Here are the salient points:

1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a diverse age range, suggesting that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively so. The ages range from the early 40s to late 50s, indicating a preference for candidates who are likely to have accumulated significant professional experience without being too close to retirement age.

2. **Language Abilities**: The successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are widely used in international diplomacy and human rights discourse. This suggests that fluency in major international languages is a significant advantage for the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This reflects the UNHRC's commitment to gender equality in leadership roles.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities and regions, including countries from different continents such as North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. This diversity underscores the importance of global representation and understanding of human rights issues across different cultural and political contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in international law and human rights, often educated in diverse legal traditions, are favored. This indicates that a broad understanding of various legal systems and international frameworks enhances a candidate's suitability for the role.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education, including both OECD countries and the global south, suggests that the UNHRC values exposure to a variety of educational environments. This diversity can equip candidates with a broader perspective on global human rights issues.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role emphasizes a balance of experience, language proficiency, gender equality, and global representation. Candidates who have studied and worked in diverse legal and educational environments are more likely to be successful, reflecting the complex and multifaceted nature of the mandate.
