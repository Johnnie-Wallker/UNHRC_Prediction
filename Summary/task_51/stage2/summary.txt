The successful candidates for the position of Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Legal Background**: All successful candidates possess a strong legal background, which is crucial for understanding and interpreting legal frameworks related to freedom of assembly and association. This background equips them to address legal challenges and advocate for legal reforms.

2. **Multifaceted Experience**: Successful candidates have diverse professional experiences, including work in academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international governmental organizations (IGOs), and government sectors. This diversity allows them to approach the mandate from multiple perspectives and leverage various networks for advocacy and implementation.

3. **Language Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a common trait among all candidates, some also demonstrate proficiency in other languages such as French and Russian. This linguistic diversity is beneficial for engaging with a global audience and understanding regional nuances.

4. **Relevant Current Job**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly or indirectly related to human rights, law, or advocacy. This ensures that they are actively involved in the field and remain up-to-date with current issues and developments.

5. **Age and Experience**: The age range of successful candidates (from 41 to 59 years) indicates a balance between youthful energy and seasoned experience. This combination is advantageous for bringing innovative ideas while drawing on a wealth of practical knowledge.

6. **Geographical Representation**: The candidates represent a variety of countries, ensuring a global perspective and equitable regional representation within the UNHRC. This diversity is essential for addressing human rights issues that may vary significantly across different cultural and political contexts.

In summary, the selection of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur position emphasizes a robust legal foundation, diverse professional experiences, linguistic capabilities, active engagement in relevant fields, a balance of age and experience, and geographical diversity. These criteria provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes within the UNHRC.
