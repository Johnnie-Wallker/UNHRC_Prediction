   - The successful candidates' ages range from 34 to 68, indicating no specific age trend.
   - Language abilities show a mix, with candidates possessing high levels in English, French, and Spanish, though some have lower proficiency in certain languages. This suggests that a diverse language skill set is valued, but not exclusively.

   - The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating no gender bias in the selection.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities including Colombia, France, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, Portugal, and Trinidad and Tobago. This suggests no specific nationality has an advantage; instead, a broad representation is favored.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The candidates' educational backgrounds include a mix of legal traditions, with some having legal education and others focusing on social sciences, humanities, and international relations. This diversity suggests that a broad range of legal and academic backgrounds is considered valuable.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - Education locations are diverse, spanning both OECD countries and the global south. Universities include those in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America.
