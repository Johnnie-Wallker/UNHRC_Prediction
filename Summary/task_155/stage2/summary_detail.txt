The summary of key features for successful candidates in the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) within the UNHRC reveals several trends and preferences that can guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The candidates tend to be mature professionals, with ages ranging from the late 30s to mid-50s. This suggests a preference for candidates who have accumulated significant experience and expertise in their fields.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English, which is a common requirement given its widespread use in international forums. Additionally, some candidates have shown capabilities in other major languages, such as Spanish, indicating a potential advantage for those with multilingual skills.

3. **Gender Balance**: The summary does not provide specific data on gender, but it is important to ensure a balanced representation of both genders to promote inclusivity and diverse perspectives. The selection process should aim for proportional representation based on the pool of applicants.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from countries like India and China have been successful, indicating a potential preference for candidates from populous and rapidly developing regions. This suggests that regional diversity and representation from key global players are valued.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in diverse legal traditions, particularly those who have worked in international law and human rights, seem to have an advantage. This indicates a preference for candidates who understand and can navigate various legal systems and frameworks.

6. **Location of Education**: The education background of candidates appears to be diverse, with successful candidates having studied in various regions. This suggests that the location of education, whether in OECD countries or the global south, does not singularly determine success, but rather a broad educational foundation is beneficial.

In conclusion, the selection process for the EMRTD within the UNHRC favors candidates who are seasoned professionals, proficient in English and possibly other major languages, and come from diverse legal and educational backgrounds. Ensuring a balanced representation of gender and regional diversity is also crucial for a successful candidate pool.
