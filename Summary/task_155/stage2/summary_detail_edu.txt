The shortlisted candidate for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from the Asia-Pacific States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibits several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. This candidate is a citizen of India, aged 39, and possesses a high level of English proficiency. His educational background is robust, with a focus on international law and human rights, which is crucial for the role. He holds a Doctorate in Peace and Conflict Studies, specializing in International Law and Human Rights, from the University for Peace, an institution established by the UN General Assembly. This specialization is particularly relevant as it delves into the intersection of multilateral trade and human rights, providing a theoretical framework that could be instrumental in the governance and implementation of human rights policies within the context of global trade. Additionally, his earlier degrees in International Law and the Settlement of Disputes, as well as a Bachelor of Laws, further solidify his expertise in legal frameworks that are central to the EMRTD's work. This candidate's academic and research focus on governance spaces and linkages between trade and human rights positions him well to contribute effectively to the mechanisms and discussions within the UNHRC, particularly in advocating for and protecting the right to development in a multilateral context.
