The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) in the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates demonstrate a diverse age range, suggesting that experience across various stages of professional life is valued. The ages of the successful candidates span from the early 40s to late 50s, indicating a preference for candidates who have accumulated substantial professional experience and are likely to have developed a robust understanding of international relations and human rights.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high level of proficiency in English, which is a common trend across all shortlisted candidates. This suggests that English fluency is a critical requirement for effective participation in international dialogues and documentation within the UN framework.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being represented among the shortlisted individuals. This indicates a commitment to inclusivity and diversity in gender representation within the mandate.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates are from diverse regions, with representation from Asia, particularly from countries like India and China. This suggests that candidates from these regions may have a slight advantage, possibly due to their active involvement and understanding of development issues within the Asian context.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, particularly in terms of international law and human rights, seems to be a significant factor. Candidates with backgrounds in international law, human rights, and public policy are more likely to be successful, reflecting the specialized nature of the EMRTD mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the Global South. This suggests that a broad educational background, encompassing different legal and cultural contexts, is beneficial. Universities in countries like the UK, China, and India are represented, indicating a preference for candidates who have exposure to diverse educational environments.

In conclusion, the selection of candidates for the EMRTD in the UNHRC emphasizes a range of factors including age, language proficiency, gender balance, regional diversity, legal expertise, and educational diversity. These factors collectively ensure that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address the complex and multifaceted issues related to the right to development.
