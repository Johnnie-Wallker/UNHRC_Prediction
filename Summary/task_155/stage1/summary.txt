The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from Asia-Pacific States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Strong Legal and Academic Backgrounds**: Successful candidates demonstrated a robust combination of legal and academic qualifications. This dual background is crucial as it equips them with the necessary theoretical knowledge and practical legal expertise to address complex human rights issues effectively.

2. **Diverse Professional Experiences**: The selected candidates have engaged in a variety of professional settings, including academic institutions, international governmental organizations (IGOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This diversity in experience ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to the multifaceted nature of human rights development.

3. **Relevant Current Job Roles**: The candidates are currently involved in roles that are directly related to law and human rights, either through academic research, legal practice, or advocacy within IGOs and NGOs. This relevance in their current job roles indicates their active engagement and contribution to the field of human rights.

4. **Language Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a common trait among the successful candidates, some also possess additional language skills, particularly in their native languages. This linguistic capability is beneficial for effective communication and collaboration within the diverse UNHRC environment.

5. **Geographical Representation**: The candidates come from various countries within the Asia-Pacific region, ensuring a broad representation that reflects the diversity and specific needs of the region. This geographical diversity is essential for addressing regional challenges and fostering inclusive development strategies.

In summary, the selection of candidates for the EMRTD emphasizes the importance of a strong legal and academic foundation, diverse professional experiences, relevant current job roles, language proficiency, and geographical representation. These criteria provide a clear framework for identifying candidates who are well-equipped to contribute effectively to the advancement of the right to development within the UNHRC.
