1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates show a range in age, with some being in their 40s (e.g., Candidate ID: 766ebc) and others in their 60s and 70s (e.g., Candidate ID: 46922a, 04ecb1, 157977). This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is a mix of younger perspectives.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with successful candidates demonstrating proficiency in multiple languages, including English, French, Arabic, and Spanish. This indicates that multilingualism is a significant advantage, especially given the international and potentially multilingual contexts of the role.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both male and female applicants (e.g., Candidate ID: b2eeb7 is female, while others are male). This suggests that gender does not confer a distinct advantage; rather, qualifications and experience are the primary criteria.

3. **Nationality**:
   - Successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including Austria, Sudan, South Sudan, the Netherlands, and the United States. This diversity indicates that no single nationality has an inherent advantage; instead, the selection is based on merit and suitability for the role.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including civil law (e.g., Candidate ID: f5deae with a background in Sudanese and UK legal systems) and common law (e.g., Candidate ID: b2eeb7 with a US legal background). This suggests that familiarity with different legal traditions is beneficial but not decisive.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity**:
   - Successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries (e.g., Candidate ID: 46922a studied in Austria and at the European Academy) and non-OECD countries (e.g., Candidate ID: f5deae studied in Sudan and the UK). This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the location and diversity of education are considered valuable, reflecting a broad understanding and experience of different educational and cultural contexts.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, nationalities, legal traditions, and educational backgrounds. The selection process appears to prioritize experience, qualifications, and the ability to operate in diverse international contexts, rather than any single demographic or educational characteristic.
