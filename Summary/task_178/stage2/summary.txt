The successful candidates for the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention within the UN Human Rights Council from African States exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate high proficiency in English and French, which are crucial for effective communication and collaboration within the international arena of the UNHRC. This multilingual ability ensures that candidates can engage with a diverse range of stakeholders and understand various perspectives.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a blend of legal, NGO, government, and potentially academic and corporate backgrounds are favored. This diversity in experience equips them with a comprehensive understanding of human rights issues from multiple angles, including legal frameworks, practical implementation, advocacy, and policy-making.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently employed in government roles are seen as advantageous. This indicates their active involvement and influence in policy-making and governance, which is essential for the effective execution of the Working Group's mandate.

4. **Age and Experience**: The age range of successful candidates typically spans from the late 50s to early 60s, suggesting a preference for individuals with substantial experience and maturity in dealing with complex human rights issues. This age group is likely to have accumulated the necessary skills, knowledge, and diplomatic acumen to navigate the challenges of the role effectively.

These characteristics collectively ensure that candidates are well-equipped to address the complexities of arbitrary detention, advocate for human rights, and contribute effectively to the international dialogue and actions within the UNHRC.
