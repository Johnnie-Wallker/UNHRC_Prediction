4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The educational backgrounds of the shortlisted candidates reflect a mix of common law and civil law traditions, as evidenced by their education in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. This indicates that familiarity with different legal traditions is beneficial but not decisive.
