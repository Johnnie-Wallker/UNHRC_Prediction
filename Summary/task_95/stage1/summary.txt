The successful candidates for the role of Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia within the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes:

1. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Successful candidates have demonstrated a blend of professional experiences across various sectors. This includes a strong presence in academic, legal, and international governmental organizations (IGOs), as well as backgrounds in government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private companies. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to human rights issues.

2. **Multilingual Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a baseline requirement, candidates who possess additional language skills, particularly French and Arabic, which are relevant to the region, are favored. This linguistic diversity aids in effective communication and understanding within the international community and the local context of Somalia.

3. **Relevant Current Job Experience**: Candidates whose current roles are closely related to law, IGOs, or government positions are considered more favorably. This reflects the need for practical experience in governance, international relations, and legal frameworks, which are crucial for addressing human rights issues effectively.

4. **Age and Experience**: The selected candidates range in age, indicating that a balance of maturity and relevant experience is valued. This suggests that while younger candidates with appropriate skills and backgrounds are considered, seasoned professionals with extensive experience in human rights and international relations are also highly regarded.

5. **Geographical and Cultural Relevance**: Candidates from diverse geographical backgrounds, including those from countries with significant interactions or relationships with Somalia, are preferred. This enhances the candidate's ability to understand and navigate the complex socio-political landscape of the region.

In summary, the selection process emphasizes candidates who possess a robust and diverse professional background, relevant current job experience, multilingual capabilities, and a balance of age and experience, all of which are crucial for effectively addressing the human rights situation in Somalia.
