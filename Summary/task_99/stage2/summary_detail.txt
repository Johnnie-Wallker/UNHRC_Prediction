Based on the information provided, the following key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in the United Nations Human Rights Council can be summarized:

1. **Age Range**: The candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 36 to 79 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit or preference.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English, with varying levels of fluency in other major languages such as French, Russian, and Arabic. This indicates that fluency in English is essential, while additional language skills can be advantageous.

3. **Gender Balance**: The sample includes both male and female candidates, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the shortlisted candidates appears balanced, reflecting a commitment to gender equality.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The candidates hail from diverse regions including Europe (Greece), Eastern Europe (Belarus), North Africa (Algeria), and Africa (Zambia). This diversity indicates that the selection process values representation from various global regions, with no single region or country dominating the shortlist.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' legal backgrounds are predominantly rooted in international law and human rights, regardless of their nationality or the legal traditions of their countries. This suggests that expertise in international law and human rights is crucial, rather than the specific legal tradition of the candidate's origin.

6. **Location of Education**: The candidates have studied in a variety of locations, including prestigious universities in both OECD countries and the global south. This diversity in educational backgrounds indicates that the selection process values education from a range of international institutions, emphasizing the quality of education over the geographical location of the university.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Special Rapporteur position prioritize candidates with extensive expertise in international law and human rights, fluency in English and additional major languages, and a balanced representation of gender and regional diversity. The educational background should be robust and diverse, irrespective of the geographical location of the institution.
