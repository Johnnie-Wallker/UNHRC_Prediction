1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) exhibit a wide age range, spanning from the early 30s to the late 60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential for fresh perspectives from younger candidates.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess high proficiency in English and French, which are major languages used in international human rights discourse. Some candidates also demonstrate intermediate or low proficiency in other languages, indicating that while fluency in major languages is advantageous, a broader linguistic skill set can be beneficial.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, with a relatively balanced representation. This indicates that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other, promoting diversity in gender representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates are drawn from diverse African countries, including Algeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria, and others. This diversity underscores the importance of regional representation and the recognition of indigenous rights expertise across different African nations.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Successful candidates often have a strong legal background, with education and experience in areas such as international human rights law, environmental management, and political science. This suggests that a legal education, particularly one that intersects with human rights and indigenous issues, is highly relevant.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates' education is spread across various regions, including Europe, North America, and Africa. This diversity in educational locations indicates that both global north and global south institutions contribute to the development of expertise in indigenous rights, reflecting the international nature of human rights work.

In summary, the selection process for EMRIP members in the UNHRC emphasizes a balance of experience and fresh perspectives across a wide age range, fluency in major international languages, gender diversity, regional representation from across Africa, a strong legal and human rights background, and a diverse educational experience that spans both global north and south institutions.
