The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC reveals several trends and characteristics that could guide the selection process:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from the late 30s to the mid-60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the energy and fresh perspectives that younger candidates can bring.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common requirement, as all shortlisted candidates possess high English language skills. Additionally, some candidates have intermediate to high proficiency in other major languages, such as Arabic or French, indicating that multilingualism is advantageous but not mandatory.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender appears to be balanced, reflecting a commitment to gender equality in the selection.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from diverse regions, including Asia, are represented, with notable presence from countries like China, Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and India. This suggests that a broad regional representation is valued, ensuring a wide range of perspectives and experiences related to indigenous rights.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Many candidates have a strong background in law, either through education or professional experience, particularly in human rights law. This indicates that a legal background, especially in areas relevant to indigenous rights, is highly advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: The majority of candidates have been educated in their home regions, primarily in Asia. This suggests that the location of education, whether in OECD countries or the global south, is less critical than the relevance and quality of the education received in the field of human rights and indigenous rights.

In conclusion, the selection process for EMRIP members in the UNHRC seems to prioritize candidates with a strong background in human rights law, particularly those with experience in indigenous rights, regardless of their age or the specific location of their education. Multilingualism is beneficial, but English proficiency is essential. The selection also aims for a balanced representation of gender and regions, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive approach to addressing indigenous rights issues.
