1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) member from the Pacific in the UN Human Rights Council exhibit a diverse age range, spanning from the early 40s to the mid-50s. This suggests that a broad spectrum of experience and maturity is valued in candidates for this role.

2. **Language Abilities**: All successful candidates are highly proficient in English, which is consistent with the language requirements for UNHRC mandates. Some candidates also possess additional language skills, such as French or Spanish, though these are not universally required.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This reflects the UN's commitment to gender equality in its appointments.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates from Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea are represented among the shortlisted candidates. This suggests a preference for candidates from the Pacific region, aligning with the mandate's focus on indigenous rights in this area.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with strong backgrounds in law, particularly in areas related to indigenous rights and international law, are favored. The legal traditions associated with their education and professional experience, often from common law jurisdictions like Australia and New Zealand, seem to be advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates are educated in a variety of locations, primarily in Australia and New Zealand, which are recognized for their strong legal education systems. This indicates that while education in reputable institutions is important, there is not a strict requirement for education in OECD countries or a specific geographic diversity in educational backgrounds.

In summary, the selection process for EMRIP members from the Pacific emphasizes candidates with a broad range of ages, strong English proficiency, balanced gender representation, and a focus on the Pacific region. Candidates with robust legal backgrounds in indigenous and international law, educated in respected institutions, are particularly well-suited for this role.
