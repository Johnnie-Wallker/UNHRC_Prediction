1. **Age and Language Abilities:**
   - The successful candidates' ages range from 41 to 68, indicating a diverse age range.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are varied, with proficiency in English being common, and additional languages including French, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese also represented. This suggests that while English proficiency is important, multilingual abilities can be advantageous.

2. **Gender:**
   - All successful candidates are female, indicating a significant gender bias towards women in this selection process. This could reflect a specific focus on gender issues within the role of Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes, and consequences.

3. **Nationality:**
   - The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities including Canada, India, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Jordan, and China. This indicates no specific nationality has an advantage, but rather a diverse international perspective is valued.

4. **Legal Tradition:**
   - The legal traditions of the successful candidates vary, with education and experience in both common law and civil law systems. For example, candidates educated in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom reflect common law traditions, while those educated in countries like India, China, and Belgium reflect civil law traditions. This suggests that a broad understanding of different legal systems is beneficial.

5. **Location of Education and Diversity:**
   - The location of education is diverse, with candidates educated in both OECD countries (e.g., United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Norway) and non-OECD countries (e.g., India, China). This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that international exposure and understanding of global south issues are highly valued.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages and language proficiencies, with a clear bias towards female candidates. Nationality does not appear to be a determining factor, and a diverse legal background and educational experience, including both OECD and non-OECD countries, are considered advantageous.
