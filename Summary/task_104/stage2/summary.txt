The successful candidates for the position of Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar at the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Legal Expertise**: All successful candidates possess a strong legal background, which is crucial for navigating complex human rights issues and legal frameworks specific to Myanmar.

2. **Multifaceted Professional Experience**: Successful candidates have demonstrated experience in multiple sectors relevant to the role. This includes backgrounds in international governmental organizations (IGO), non-governmental organizations (NGO), government, academia, and private companies. This diverse experience equips them to address human rights issues from various angles and leverage different networks and resources.

3. **Language Proficiency**: While English proficiency is a must, successful candidates also show varying degrees of proficiency in other languages such as French, Russian, and Chinese. This linguistic diversity is beneficial for engaging with a broader range of stakeholders and understanding cultural contexts within and outside Myanmar.

4. **Age and Experience**: The age range of successful candidates typically spans from the late 40s to the early 60s, indicating a preference for candidates with a substantial amount of professional experience and maturity in handling international human rights issues.

5. **Current Relevance**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly or indirectly related to law, which ensures they remain active and updated in legal and human rights discourse.

These key features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes within the UNHRC, emphasizing the need for a blend of legal expertise, diverse professional backgrounds, linguistic capabilities, and relevant current engagement in human rights-related fields.
