1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, spanning from the early 50s to the early 70s. This suggests that experience and maturity, rather than a specific age, are valued attributes for this mandate.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically possess a high level of English proficiency, which is likely essential given the international nature of the UNHRC. While some candidates have a basic understanding of other major languages like French and Spanish, high proficiency in English appears to be a key requirement.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced representation. This suggests that the selection process is equitable in terms of gender, with no clear advantage for either sex.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Candidates come from diverse regions including Australia, India, Austria, Germany, and Serbia. This diversity reflects a broad geographical representation, suggesting that no single region or country has a distinct advantage.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The successful candidates have backgrounds in various legal traditions, including common law (e.g., Australia, India) and civil law (e.g., Germany, Austria). This indicates that a diverse legal background is beneficial, rather than a specific legal tradition.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates have been educated in both OECD countries (e.g., Australia, UK, Germany) and non-OECD countries (e.g., India). This diversity in educational locations suggests that a varied educational background, encompassing both global north and south, is considered advantageous.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons in the UNHRC favor candidates with a broad range of ages, high English proficiency, balanced gender representation, diverse nationalities, varied legal traditions, and education from different global regions.
