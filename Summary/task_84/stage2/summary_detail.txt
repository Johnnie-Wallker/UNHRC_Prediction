1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, suggesting that experience and maturity are valued, but not exclusively tied to age. The candidates' ages span from the early 40s to the late 50s, indicating a preference for candidates who are likely to have accumulated substantial professional experience and expertise in their fields.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates typically demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential given the international nature of the UNHRC meetings. Some candidates also possess additional language skills, such as French or Spanish, although these are not universally required, indicating that English fluency is a primary criterion.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender appears to be balanced, reflecting an inclusive approach that values diversity in representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from the Pacific region, particularly Australia, New Zealand, and Tonga, are well-represented among the shortlisted candidates. This indicates a preference for candidates who have a deep understanding of the Pacific context and its indigenous peoples, reflecting the regional focus of the mandate.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in international law and human rights, particularly those who have studied or worked in common law jurisdictions, seem to have an advantage. This is evident from the candidates' educational backgrounds and professional experiences, which often include work with international legal frameworks and indigenous rights.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have often pursued education in diverse locations, including both OECD countries and other regions. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that a global perspective and exposure to different legal and cultural contexts are highly valued. Candidates who have studied in prestigious institutions internationally are more likely to be successful, reflecting the importance of academic excellence and international exposure.

In summary, the selection process for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) in the UNHRC favors candidates who are experienced, linguistically proficient in English, gender-balanced, regionally knowledgeable, and educated in diverse and prestigious institutions. These criteria ensure that the selected candidates are well-equipped to address the complex and sensitive issues related to indigenous peoples' rights within the Pacific region and beyond.
