The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) member from the Pacific in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several significant trends and characteristics:

1. **Age Trend**: The age range of the shortlisted candidates is diverse, with one candidate being 59 years old and others' ages unspecified. This suggests that age is not a decisive factor in the selection process, emphasizing the importance of experience and expertise over a specific age bracket.

2. **Language Abilities**: All successful candidates exhibit a high level of English proficiency, which is crucial given the international and predominantly English-speaking context of the UNHRC. This indicates that fluency in English is a significant requirement for the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, suggesting a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This balance helps ensure diverse perspectives and equitable representation.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The candidates represent a range of Pacific nations, including New Zealand, Tonga, Samoa, and potentially other Pacific Island countries. This diversity in nationality underscores the importance of regional representation and understanding of local indigenous issues.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' backgrounds in law, particularly international and indigenous rights law, are prominent. This suggests that a legal background, especially one that intersects with indigenous rights and international law, is highly advantageous.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is notable, with candidates having studied in various countries including the UK, USA, Australia, and New Zealand. This indicates that a broad educational background, encompassing both OECD countries and the global south, is valued in the selection process.

In conclusion, the selection criteria for the EMRIP member from the Pacific emphasize a diverse range of experiences and expertise, balanced gender representation, fluency in English, and a strong legal background in international and indigenous rights.
