The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and preferences:

1. **Age Range**: The successful candidates tend to fall within a mature age range, typically between 42 to 60 years old. This suggests a preference for candidates who have accumulated substantial experience and expertise in human rights and related fields.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are generally required to have a high proficiency in English, which is a common trend across all shortlisted candidates. Additionally, some candidates also possess proficiency in other major languages such as French, indicating that multilingualism is valued, particularly in languages relevant to global governance and human rights discourse.

3. **Gender Representation**: The summary does not explicitly mention gender, which suggests that the selection process may be gender-neutral or balanced, focusing more on qualifications and experience rather than gender.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates come from diverse nationalities, including India, the United States, Ireland, and Senegal. This indicates a preference for geographical diversity, ensuring representation from various regions and legal traditions.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The candidates' success does not seem to be heavily influenced by the legal tradition of their nationality or education location. Candidates from common law (United States) and civil law (India, Senegal) backgrounds are represented, suggesting a balanced consideration of different legal traditions.

6. **Location of Education**: Successful candidates have received education in diverse locations, including both OECD countries (United States, Ireland) and the global south (India, Senegal). This suggests that the selection committee values educational diversity and does not necessarily favor education from specific regions.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur role in the UNHRC appears to prioritize candidates who are mature, highly proficient in English, and possess a broad range of experiences and educational backgrounds from diverse geographical and legal contexts. The process seems to aim for a balanced representation of gender and a wide geographical spread to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach to the mandate.
