The successful candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, member from African States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features include:

1. **Bilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in both English and French, which are the two official working languages of the UN. This linguistic capability ensures effective communication and collaboration within the international framework of the UNHRC.

2. **Relevant Backgrounds**: Candidates with backgrounds in legal expertise and government experience are favored. This is crucial as the role involves addressing human rights issues and policy-making, areas where legal knowledge and governmental insights are essential. Additionally, candidates with NGO or academic backgrounds, particularly in law, are also considered advantageous, as they bring diverse perspectives and in-depth understanding of human rights issues.

3. **Cultural and Linguistic Diversity**: Proficiency in additional languages such as Arabic, although not mandatory, is beneficial. It reflects the candidate's ability to engage with a broader range of stakeholders and understand the complexities of different cultural contexts within the African continent.

4. **Age and Experience**: While there is no strict age criterion, candidates with a blend of youth and experience are preferred. Younger candidates bring fresh perspectives and energy, while older candidates offer maturity and extensive experience in their fields.

5. **Current Relevance**: Candidates whose current jobs are related to government, academia, or law are seen as more suitable, as they are actively engaged in relevant sectors that align with the objectives of the UNHRC.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, ensuring that candidates not only meet the technical requirements but also contribute effectively to the broader goals of the UNHRC in promoting and protecting the rights of people of African descent.
