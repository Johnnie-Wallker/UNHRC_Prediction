Based on the provided information, the following key features of successful candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, member from African States in the United Nations Human Rights Council can be summarized:

1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the early 40s to the mid-60s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for selection.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in major international languages, particularly English and French. Proficiency in additional languages, such as Arabic, can be advantageous but is not uniformly required.

3. **Gender Balance**: The information provided does not indicate a significant gender bias. The summary does not specify the gender of the candidates, so it is not possible to assess the proportion of each gender. However, the selection process appears to be inclusive without a clear gender-based advantage.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from diverse African countries, including Guinea, South Africa, and Morocco. This indicates that the selection process values regional diversity and does not favor any particular nationality or region over others.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with a strong background in law and political science, particularly in international law and human rights, are more likely to be successful. The legal tradition, as reflected by the candidates' educational and professional backgrounds, plays a significant role in their selection.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates who have studied in diverse locations, including both African and international universities, are favored. This suggests that the selection process values a broad educational perspective and does not exclusively favor education from OECD countries or the global south.

In summary, the selection process for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent emphasizes candidates with a wide age range, proficiency in major international languages, regional diversity, strong legal and human rights backgrounds, and a diverse educational experience. The process appears to be inclusive and balanced, focusing on the candidates' qualifications and experience rather than specific demographic characteristics.
