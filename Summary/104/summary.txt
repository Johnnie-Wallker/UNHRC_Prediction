1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates range in age from 42 to 63, indicating that both younger and older candidates can be successful.
   - Language abilities among the successful candidates are diverse, with proficiency in English being common, and varying levels of proficiency in other languages such as French, Russian, and Spanish. This suggests that while English proficiency is important, having a broader language skill set can be advantageous.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both men and women, indicating that gender does not seem to be a decisive factor in the selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds, including the United Kingdom, South Korea, United States, Finland, and Pakistan. This suggests that there is no specific nationality that holds an advantage, and the selection is based on a broader range of criteria.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The successful candidates have educational backgrounds from various legal traditions, including common law (United Kingdom, United States), civil law (South Korea, Finland), and mixed systems (Pakistan). This diversity indicates that familiarity with different legal traditions is valued, and candidates with a broad legal education are likely to be successful.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The successful candidates have studied in both OECD countries and non-OECD countries, reflecting a diverse educational background. This suggests that the location of education, whether in the global north or south, does not necessarily determine success, but rather the quality and relevance of the education received.

In summary, the successful candidates demonstrate a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, and educational backgrounds. The selection process appears to value diversity in these aspects, emphasizing the importance of a broad legal education and relevant experience over specific demographic traits.
