The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, member from Latin American and Caribbean States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, based on the shortlisted candidates, reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 34 to 68 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the potential of younger candidates who bring fresh perspectives and innovative approaches.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English and Spanish, with some also proficient in French. This multilingual proficiency aligns with the need to communicate effectively within the diverse linguistic context of the UN and the Latin American and Caribbean regions.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. This reflects the UN's commitment to gender equality and inclusivity.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The majority of successful candidates come from countries within the Caribbean and Latin America, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, and Costa Rica. This highlights the importance of regional representation and understanding of local contexts.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in legal traditions, particularly those with experience in human rights law and international law, are more likely to be successful. This is evident from the educational and professional backgrounds of the shortlisted candidates, many of whom have degrees in law and have worked in international human rights organizations or governmental roles related to human rights.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is evident, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This suggests that the quality of education, rather than its geographic location, is a key factor in the selection process. However, education in prestigious international institutions or those with a strong focus on human rights and international relations seems to be advantageous.

In conclusion, the selection process for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent emphasizes a balance of experience and innovation, multilingual proficiency, gender equality, regional representation, legal expertise, and the quality of education. These factors collectively contribute to the selection of candidates who can effectively contribute to the mandate of the UNHRC in addressing issues related to people of African descent.
