1. **Age Trend**: The successful candidates exhibit a diverse age range, spanning from the early 30s to the late 60s. This indicates that experience and expertise across different career stages are valued, rather than a specific age bracket.

2. **Language Abilities**: Fluency in English is a common trait among the successful candidates, with most having a high proficiency level. Additionally, proficiency in Spanish and French is observed, suggesting that multilingual capabilities are advantageous, particularly in languages relevant to the regions involved.

3. **Gender Balance**: The selection process appears to be balanced in terms of gender, with both male and female candidates being shortlisted. This suggests that the selection is not skewed towards one gender, promoting inclusivity.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: Successful candidates come from a variety of countries across Latin America and the Caribbean, indicating a preference for regional diversity. Countries like Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, and Brazil are represented, reflecting a broad geographical spread.

5. **Legal Tradition**: While some candidates have backgrounds in law, others come from diverse academic and professional backgrounds including history, anthropology, and human rights advocacy. This suggests that a legal background is not a mandatory requirement, but rather a diverse range of expertise is valued.

6. **Location of Education**: Education from both local and international institutions, including those in OECD countries and the Global South, is represented. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that the selection committee values a broad educational perspective, whether it be from within the region or internationally.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent from Latin American and Caribbean States in the UNHRC emphasize a diverse range of ages, language proficiencies, gender equality, regional representation, and educational diversity. These factors collectively contribute to a well-rounded and inclusive selection process.
