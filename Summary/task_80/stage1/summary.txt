The successful candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, member from Western European and other States in the United Nations Human Rights Council, exhibit several key features that align with the mandate and requirements of the role. These features provide a clear guideline for future candidate selection processes within the UNHRC:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication within the international arena. Additionally, many possess intermediate to high levels of proficiency in other languages such as French and Spanish, enhancing their ability to engage with diverse stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The shortlisted candidates have a broad range of professional experiences, including backgrounds in legal, academic, company, IGO (Intergovernmental Organization), NGO (Non-Governmental Organization), and government sectors. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding and approach to human rights issues.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Candidates currently employed in roles related to academia, IGOs, NGOs, and law are favored, reflecting the need for practical experience and active engagement in human rights advocacy and policy-making.

4. **Age Diversity**: The age range of the successful candidates is broad, from mid-30s to 60s, indicating that both seasoned professionals and those with significant but not overly extensive experience are considered valuable.

5. **Cultural and National Diversity**: While most candidates are from Western European and other States, there is also recognition of the importance of having candidates with dual citizenship or a strong connection to countries with significant populations of people of African descent. This enhances the group's ability to address issues from multiple cultural and national perspectives.

These key features underscore the importance of linguistic ability, professional versatility, active engagement in relevant fields, and a commitment to representing diverse perspectives in the selection of candidates for the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent within the UNHRC.
