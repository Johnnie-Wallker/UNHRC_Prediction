The successful candidates for the role of Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Legal Background**: All successful candidates possess a strong legal background, which is crucial for understanding and addressing issues related to human rights law, international law, and the specific mandate of investigating and reporting on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions.

2. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate proficiency in multiple languages, particularly English and French, which are the working languages of the UN. Some also have proficiency in Arabic, enhancing their ability to communicate and engage with a broader range of stakeholders.

3. **Diverse Professional Experience**: The candidates have varied professional backgrounds, including government, academic, NGO, and international governmental organizations (IGOs). This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of different perspectives and approaches to human rights issues.

4. **Relevant Current Job Experience**: Many successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly or indirectly related to human rights, law, and governance. This includes positions in government, academia, and NGOs, which provide them with practical experience and insights into the challenges and solutions related to the mandate.

5. **Age and Maturity**: The age range of the successful candidates (from mid-40s to late 60s) indicates a balance between experience and energy. Older candidates bring a wealth of experience, while younger candidates may offer fresh perspectives and a strong work ethic.

6. **International Exposure**: Candidates with dual citizenship or those who have worked in multiple countries demonstrate an understanding of international contexts and the ability to navigate diverse cultural and political landscapes.

These key features collectively ensure that the selected candidates are well-equipped to fulfill the responsibilities of the Special Rapporteur role effectively, contributing to the advancement of human rights and the prevention of extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions globally.
