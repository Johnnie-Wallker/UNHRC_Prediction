1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from 34 to 53. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but so is the energy and innovative thinking that younger candidates can bring. The presence of candidates in their 30s and 50s indicates a balanced consideration of both seasoned professionals and those with potentially fresh perspectives.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to have a high proficiency in English, which is consistent with the primary working language of the UN. Some candidates also demonstrate proficiency in French, which is beneficial given the international and particularly African context where French is widely spoken. The absence of Spanish proficiency among the candidates suggests it is not a mandatory requirement for this mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The presence of both male and female candidates in the shortlist indicates a balanced approach to gender representation. This suggests that the selection process does not favor one gender over the other, aligning with the UN's commitment to gender equality in leadership roles.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The candidates represent diverse African nations, including Uganda, South Africa, and Nigeria. This diversity in nationality suggests that the selection process values representation from various regions within Africa, ensuring a broad understanding and perspective on the right to development issues across the continent.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The success of candidates from different legal traditions, based on their nationalities and the locations of their professional engagements, indicates that a variety of legal backgrounds are considered advantageous. This diversity in legal traditions enhances the ability of the mechanism to address complex, cross-jurisdictional development issues.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education, including both African and international institutions, is evident among the candidates. This suggests that education in both the Global South and the Global North is valued, reflecting the need for a comprehensive understanding of global human rights issues as well as regional specificities.

In summary, the selection criteria for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development favor candidates who demonstrate a balance of experience and innovation, linguistic proficiency in major international languages, gender equality, regional diversity, a variety of legal traditions, and education from diverse geographic locations. These factors collectively contribute to a robust and effective mechanism capable of addressing the multifaceted issues related to the right to development.
