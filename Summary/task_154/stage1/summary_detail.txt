The summary of key features of successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) member from African States in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) reveals several trends and characteristics that may guide future candidate selection processes:

1. **Age Range**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the mid-30s to the early 50s. This suggests that a diverse age range is valued, reflecting a balance between experience and potential for future contributions.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English, with some also possessing proficiency in French. This indicates that multilingual abilities, particularly in major international languages like English and French, are advantageous for the mandate.

3. **Gender Balance**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating that the selection process does not overtly favor one gender over the other. The proportion of each gender among the successful candidates is relatively balanced, reinforcing a commitment to gender equality in the selection.

4. **Nationality and Regional Representation**: The successful candidates hail from diverse African countries, including Uganda, South Africa, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This diversity underscores the importance of regional representation and the value placed on varied national perspectives.

5. **Legal Tradition**: The legal tradition, based on nationality and location of education, does not appear to be a decisive factor. Candidates with education and experience in both common law and civil law systems are represented, suggesting that a broad legal background is beneficial.

6. **Location of Education**: The diversity in the location of education is notable, with candidates having studied in various regions including Africa, Europe, and North America. This indicates that a global educational background, encompassing both OECD countries and the global south, is considered advantageous.
