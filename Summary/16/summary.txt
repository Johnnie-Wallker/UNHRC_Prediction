This diversity in language skills indicates a preference for candidates who can communicate effectively in multiple languages, which is crucial for international roles.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The legal traditions of the candidates vary, with backgrounds in civil law (e.g., Spain, Brazil) and common law (e.g., Ireland, India). This diversity in legal traditions indicates that a broad understanding of different legal systems is beneficial for the role.

5. **Location of Education**:
   - The location of education is diverse, with candidates having studied in both OECD countries and the global south. This suggests that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued, reflecting a global perspective and understanding of different legal and social contexts.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a diverse range of ages, language abilities, nationalities, legal traditions, and educational backgrounds. The predominance of female candidates suggests a specific focus on gender in this role. The diversity in all other aspects indicates a preference for candidates who can bring a broad and inclusive perspective to the role of Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children.
