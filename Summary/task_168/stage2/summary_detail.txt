1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, from 48 to 73 years old. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age limit for suitability.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English and French, as all shortlisted candidates possess high levels in these languages. Spanish proficiency, while present in some candidates, is not uniformly required.

3. **Gender Proportion**: The shortlisted candidates include both males and females, indicating a balanced consideration of gender in the selection process. The proportion of each gender is similar, reflecting an inclusive approach.

4. **Nationality and Regional Advantage**: Candidates from diverse regions, including Australia, the United Kingdom and Brazil, the United States and India, Portugal, and France, were shortlisted. This suggests no specific regional or national advantage, emphasizing a global perspective in candidate selection.

5. **Legal Tradition**: Candidates with backgrounds in common law (Australia, United States) and civil law (France, Portugal, United Kingdom) were equally represented. This indicates that familiarity with different legal traditions enhances a candidate's suitability, reflecting the international nature of the mandate.

6. **Location of Education**: Candidates educated in both OECD countries (e.g., Oxford, Harvard) and non-OECD countries (e.g., University of Madras) were shortlisted. This diversity in educational backgrounds suggests that exposure to different educational environments and perspectives is valued, enhancing the candidate's ability to address global housing rights issues.

In summary, the selection process for the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to non-discrimination in that context in the United Nations Human Rights Council values a diverse range of ages, language proficiencies, gender balance, national and regional diversity, familiarity with various legal traditions, and educational diversity. This holistic approach ensures that the chosen candidate can effectively address the complex and global nature of the mandate.
