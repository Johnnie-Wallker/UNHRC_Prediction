The successful candidates for the position of Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to non-discrimination in that context in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English, which is essential for effective communication within the international arena. Additionally, candidates with high proficiency in French and some level of Spanish are preferred, reflecting the multilingual nature of the UNHRC and the need to engage with a diverse range of stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: Candidates with a blend of legal, academic, and international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds are favored. This combination ensures a deep understanding of human rights law, academic rigor in research and analysis, and practical experience in international governance and policy-making.

3. **Experience in Government, NGOs, and Academia**: Candidates who have worked in government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and academia bring a comprehensive perspective on housing rights. This diverse experience facilitates a holistic approach to addressing housing issues, combining policy-making insights, grassroots advocacy, and scholarly research.

4. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to their backgrounds, such as government positions or academic appointments. This indicates their active involvement and continued relevance in the field of human rights and housing policy.

5. **Age and Experience**: While age is not a definitive factor, candidates with a significant amount of experience, typically reflected in their age, are considered. This experience is crucial for navigating the complexities of international human rights advocacy and policy development.

These key features provide a clear guideline for the selection process, ensuring that candidates are well-equipped to fulfill the responsibilities of the Special Rapporteur role effectively and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of housing rights globally.
