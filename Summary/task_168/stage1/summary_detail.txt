1. **Age Trend**: The shortlisted candidates exhibit a wide age range, with ages spanning from the mid-40s to the early 70s. This suggests that experience and maturity are valued, but there is no strict age requirement.

2. **Language Abilities**: Successful candidates are typically required to be fluent in English, with many also proficient in French and/or Spanish.
