The successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to non-discrimination in that context in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a strong command of English, which is essential for effective communication and documentation within the international arena. Additionally, proficiency in other languages such as French and Spanish is advantageous, reflecting the global scope of the mandate and enhancing the rapporteur's ability to engage with diverse stakeholders.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The selected candidates possess a mix of legal, academic, and international governmental organization (IGO) backgrounds. This diversity ensures a comprehensive understanding of legal frameworks, academic research, and practical experience in international human rights mechanisms.

3. **Experience in Government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**: Candidates with experience in both government and NGOs bring a balanced perspective, understanding both the policy-making process and the grassroots advocacy required to address housing rights issues. This dual experience facilitates a holistic approach to the mandate.

4. **Relevant Current Job Roles**: The successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to law, government, or academia. This relevance ensures that they are actively involved in fields that align with the mandate's objectives, providing them with up-to-date knowledge and practical skills.

5. **Age Diversity**: The age range of the successful candidates (spanning from the late 30s to the early 70s) brings a spectrum of experiences and perspectives, ensuring a blend of youthful energy and seasoned wisdom. This diversity is beneficial for addressing complex and evolving housing rights issues.

In summary, the successful candidates for the Special Rapporteur position demonstrate a strong linguistic ability, a diverse and relevant professional background, and are currently engaged in roles that align with the mandate's objectives. These qualities collectively equip them to effectively advocate for and monitor the right to adequate housing and non-discrimination within the UN Human Rights Council.
