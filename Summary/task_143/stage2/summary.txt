The successful candidates for the Expert Mechanism on the Right to Development (EMRTD) from Latin American and Caribbean States in the United Nations Human Rights Council exhibit several key features that align with the mandate's requirements. These features include:

1. **Bilingual or Multilingual Proficiency**: Successful candidates demonstrate a high level of proficiency in English and French, which are the two official working languages of the UN. This linguistic capability is crucial for effective communication and participation in international forums. Additionally, a basic to intermediate level of Spanish is noted, which is beneficial given the regional context.

2. **Diverse Professional Backgrounds**: The candidates possess a mix of legal, academic, and government backgrounds, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of human rights and development issues. This diversity ensures a multifaceted approach to addressing the right to development. Some candidates also have experience in international governmental organizations (IGOs) or non-governmental organizations (NGOs), adding a global perspective to their expertise.

3. **Relevant Current Employment**: Successful candidates are currently engaged in roles that are directly related to government, law, and academia. This indicates their active involvement and continued contribution to the field of human rights and development, ensuring their relevance and up-to-date knowledge.

4. **Age and Experience**: The candidates range in age, with most falling within the 55 to 65-year-old bracket. This age group typically brings a wealth of experience and a mature perspective, which is valuable for the nuanced and complex discussions within the EMRTD.

5. **Dual Citizenship**: Some candidates hold dual citizenship, which can enhance their ability to bridge cultural and linguistic gaps, facilitating better communication and understanding within the diverse UNHRC environment.

In summary, the successful candidates for the EMRTD are characterized by their high linguistic proficiency, diverse and relevant professional backgrounds, active engagement in related fields, substantial experience, and in some cases, the ability to bridge cultural divides through dual citizenship. These qualities collectively equip them to effectively contribute to the mandate of the EMRTD within the UNHRC.
