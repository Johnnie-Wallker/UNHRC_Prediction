1. **Age and Language Abilities**:
   - The successful candidates show a wide range of ages, from 39 to 100, indicating that age is not a decisive factor.
   - Language abilities are diverse, with candidates possessing high levels of English, French, Arabic, and Spanish. This suggests that multilingualism is valued, especially given the international nature of the role.

2. **Gender**:
   - The successful candidates include both males and females, indicating that gender does not confer a significant advantage in this selection process.

3. **Nationality**:
   - The successful candidates come from diverse national backgrounds (Chile, South Africa, Tunisia, Jordan, Costa Rica/Spain, and Russia), suggesting that no single nationality has a distinct advantage. This diversity reflects the global mandate of the UN Human Rights Council.

4. **Legal Tradition**:
   - The legal traditions represented among the successful candidates are varied, including candidates educated in civil law countries (e.g., France, Russia) and common law countries (e.g., South Africa, United States). This diversity suggests that familiarity with different legal traditions enhances a candidate's suitability for addressing the complex and varied legal issues related to disability rights globally.

5. **Location of Education**:

This indicates that the diversity of educational backgrounds is valued, reflecting the need for a broad understanding of global issues and practices in disability rights.

In summary, the successful candidates exhibit a range of ages, language abilities, genders, nationalities, and educational backgrounds, suggesting that the selection process values diversity and a broad understanding of global disability rights issues. No single factor such as age, gender, nationality, or specific legal tradition appears to dominate the selection criteria. Instead, the selection seems to prioritize candidates who bring a diverse set of skills and perspectives to the role.
